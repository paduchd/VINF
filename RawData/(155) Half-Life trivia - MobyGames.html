  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <div class="shrink-headings text-break-word"><h3>1001 Video Games</h3>
<p><em>Half-Life</em> appears in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Video_Games_You_Must_Play_Before_You_Die" rel="nofollow">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a> by General Editor Tony Mott.</p>
<h3>Advertisement</h3>
<p>Very early beta footage of the game, as well as interviews with some of the programmers, is available on the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Diablo">Diablo</a> expansion pack <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hellfire">Hellfire</a>, released by Sierra a full year before the game ever shipped. Sierra already had advertisements for <em>Half-Life</em> in many of their products back then.</p>
<h3>Cancelled ports</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Half-Life</em>, at one point, was completely finished for the Dreamcast console. Prima (the Official Strategy Guide folks) even had a Dreamcast-exclusive guide published. Unfortunately, the game wasn't published - probably due to the fact that SEGA announced that they would no longer produce new Dreamcasts. In certain circles of the Internet, a leaked copy can still be found and ran on a Dreamcast.</li>
<li>A Macintosh port was in the works from Westlake interactive and reached beta before being cancelled because of concerns about responsibility for tech support.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In its first finalized form, as it would have been published if the original release date was kept, <em>Half-Life</em> was nothing more than a total conversion of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Quake">Quake</a> with new enemies and levels. In the one additional year spent on development the game transformed into the form that led it to critical and commercial success.</p>
<h3>Engine</h3>
<p><em>Half-Life</em> was released a full year after <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Quake+II">Quake II</a> and it's a common belief that it was based on the <em>Quake II</em> engine. This is not true. It is based on the original <em>Quake</em> engine and it's more than fair to say that it was modified beyond recognition by the Valve team. Amongst the additions were built-in 3D accelerator support, skeletal systems and shadow casting (the latter didn't make it into the game). Valve now refers to this engine as "GoldSrc". This is probably how the "Source" engine from <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/15564/half-life-2/">Half-Life 2</a> got its name.</p>
<h3>German version</h3>
<p>There is a special German version which features robots as enemies, green blood instead of red and innocent people cannot be killed any longer. The robot design was outlined by Sierra's Germany division, then sent to Valve in Seattle, where the artists created and implemented the tin soldiers. The changes in the game's code and art, together with the text and speech localization, served to delay the German version by full four months. By then, even casual gamers had already purchased the original version, which was freely for sale up to its ban. However, <em>Half-Life</em> proved to be so immensely popular that the German robo-version still sold over 50,000 copies, so the venture was ultimately successful for Sierra. </p>
<p>On December 16, 1998, the US version of <em>Half-Life</em> was put on the infamous German index by the BPjS. For more information about what this means and to see a list of games sharing the same fate, take a look here: <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=BPjS/BPjM+indexed+games">BPjS/BPjM indexed games</a>.</p>
<h3>Gina Freeman</h3>
<p>Apparently, Valve had written a part for Gordon's wife, Gina, to appear in the game, this idea got scrapped but she still made it to the game, her model was the one used for the holographic trainer.</p>
<h3>id Software</h3>
<p>When id Software saw what Valve was doing with their engine, they were reminded of their original idea for a seamless, story-based <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=DOOM:+Evil+Unleashed">DOOM</a> and thought it would fail. It didn't.</p>
<h3>Innovations</h3>
<p><em>Half-Life</em> was influential in many little ways, popularising several gameplay devices which have subsequently become standards, such as: * The between-episode text which appears, overlaid on the screen, before slowly fading out (adopted not just in other computer games, but in several different Linux windowing systems too)
* A training segment which is presented as an integral part of the storyline
* The practice of rendering cut-scenes with the in-game engine
* Blood-splatters and other persistent stains
* Semi-random NPC speech and 'interaction' in an otherwise straightforward action game
* Weaponry which needs to be manually reloaded between magazine changes
* Constant playflow: the levels directly connect to each other</p>
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>According to Valve's <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/22354/gabe-newell/">Gabe Newell</a>, originally <em>Half-Life</em> was inspired by <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Stephen+King">Stephen King</a>'s novella <em>The Mist</em>. However the game evolved so much from the preliminary concepts that the only things that remained were the horror/technology combination and the designs for the Bull Squid and the blind tentacle.</p>
<h3>Lambda</h3>
<p><em>Half-Life's</em> lambda symbol is not the scientific symbol for half-life, but is instead the decay constant in the differential equation for exponential decay. The actual scientific symbol used for half-life is t1/2.</p>
<h3>Mods</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/2726/half-life-counter-strike/">Counter-Strike</a> was not a freak occurrence. Valve made the game editor immediately available, produced the mod <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1793/team-fortress-classic/">Team Fortress Classic</a> as an example of a finished mod, and also sponsored "Mod Expos", events where modders could present their work to other gamers and the press.</p>
<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://planethalflife.com" rel="nofollow">planethalflife.com</a>: "the material that makes up the three green triangles protecting Nihilanth is the same as the crystal sample which you pushed into the beams to start this whole mess in the first place. Valve Software originally intended to make this connection more obvious but never did."</p>

<li>The Gluon Gun was nicknamed "The Egon" after the <em>Ghostbusters</em> Character Egon Spengler. The Gluon gun projects a plasma stream similar to the ones used by the Ghostbusters.</li>
<li>The surnames on the lockers where Gordon goes to collect his HEV suit are of people from the development team. Gordon also has a book by <em>Half-Life</em> writer <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Marc+Laidlaw">Marc Laidlaw</a> in his locker.</li>
</ul>
<h3>References to the game</h3>
<p>The game makes an appearance in season 1, episode 22 of <em>Lost</em>, a popular TV series. Some in-game action is shown, and the characters shortly discuss the use and the effectiveness of the crowbar as a weapon.</p>
<h3>Remakes</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 2004, Valve released a re-mastered version using <em>Half Life 2</em>'s Source engine, called <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/42682/half-life-source/">Half-Life: Source</a>.</li>
<li>In 2012, a group of fans released a remake of their own, called <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Black+Mesa">Black Mesa</a>. The team's goal was to provide a completely new and more modern version of the original experience, since according to them, Valve's remake "didn't fully live up to the potential of a Source engine port of Half-Life". In fact, most of the game's content remained unchanged: <em>Half-Life: Source</em> mainly added new water and physics effects, but didn't upgrade the game's textures or character models.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sales</h3>
<p>As of 2007, the game sold of over eight million since its release. (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52849-2004Nov15.html?nav=rss_technology" rel="nofollow">source</a>)</p>
<h3>Shotgun</h3>
<p>There's a minor technical error with the shotgun. It's presented in the game as a double-barreled weapon, and the alternative fire mode shoots two shells at half the speed. However, the shotgun is modeled on a single-barreled weapon, the popular Franchi SPAS-12, which appears in several computer games. What looks like a second barrel is actually the under-barrel tubular magazine, which holds the shells.</p>
<h3>Sound engine</h3>
<p><em>Half-Life</em> was one of the first games to utilize a software-driven environmental sound engine. Effects are applied in context of room size and surfaces of reflection. Reverb effects are calculated in realtime and applied on the fly as sounds are triggered.</p>
<h3>University of Innsbruck</h3>
<p>In the game manual, the first two pages contain a fictional letter from the administrative offices of the Black Mesa Research Facility to Dr. Gordon Freeman, concerning his upcoming employment. The address on the letter indicates that Freeman was a visiting fellow at the Institute for Experimental Physics, University of Innsbruck, before moving to Black Mesa. In contrast to the common practice of using fictitious addresses for storytelling purposes, the listed address is actually real. As confirmed by the official <a href="http://www.uibk.ac.at/exphys/contact.html.en" rel="nofollow">university website</a>, "TechnikerstraÃŸe 25, A-6020 Innsbruck" is the real-world location of Innsbruck University's Institute for Experimental Physics.</p>
