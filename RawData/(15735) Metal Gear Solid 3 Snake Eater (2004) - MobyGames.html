    <p>The Cold War, a situation created after the Second World War when the world was torn between East and West, is about to heat up as Soviets got their top scientist, Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov, back due to agreement with the US government for withdrawing the nuclear missiles from Cuba. Now, with Sokolov in their hands, they're up to developing a powerful new weapon, and upon realizing the urgency of the situation, CIA formed a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX unit's modus operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking mission.</p>
<p>August 24, 1964, a lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man's code name is Naked Snake. It's a one-man war now, and the future of the world may now rest entirely on his shoulders.</p>
<p><em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em> is the prequel to the entire <em>Metal Gear</em> series. Most of the series' defining gameplay elements have been carried over. As before, Snake must use stealth and wits rather than brute force to infiltrate enemy zones and eliminate his major adversaries. Action set-pieces and boss battles that require the player to figure out the enemy's weakpoints and employ unique tactics to defeat him are also present.</p>
<p>Several notable gameplay features have been added. Unlike the previous games, much of the action in this installment takes place in a large outdoor environment, the (geographically inaccurate) jungle. Snake is able to use camouflage: climb trees, hide in tall grass, or wear clothes that make him less noticeable. Snake can also grow tired and hungry; collecting rations or even hunting wild animals for food is necessary. He can sustain injuries (for example, breaking an arm), which must be treated in a specific way, as opposed to the single health bar of the predecessors.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>I liked the graphics in this game.  Everything looks sharp &amp; fluid.  A lot of work was put in for MGS3 to have some much detail.</p>
<p>The sound was awesome.  You like you're hiding in the bushes with birds, frogs, and snakes moving around you.  You can hear the wind blowing though the trees and grass.</p>
<p>Like the other MGSs, the characters are beyond words.  The characters really draw you into the story.  You just have to know where they've come from and whats going to happen to them next.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>There is a lot I didn't like about this baby.  </p>
<p>First, though the graphics are great, several times the game would freeze and twice it crashed during while I was playing.  I found it very annoying MGS3 would freeze right when I was focusing on a enemy to shoot before he got to me.  The PS2 just can't handle the load without dropping a few balls, stop,  go back to pick them up &amp; then continue.  Its not good to freeze during the action!!</p>
<p>Then there's the length you actually play the game.  It's too damn short.  I sent more time watching cut scenes than controlling Snake.  </p>
<p>I didn't like all the stuff I had to keep up with.  I have to feed Snake, cure Snake, take things out of Snake's bag, change Snake's clothes. . . What The Hell?!  I thought I was playing MGS not the Sims!</p>
<p>And finally, I didn't like the drama.  It was like I was watching a soap opera.  I don't remember the other MG games being this bad.  I wish they would just get to the point and let me play.  Does Snake really need a love interest? He's Snake not James Bond.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Though I have a few issues with this game, Metal Gear Solid 3 is okay.  I my opinion is not a great game.  Hell, far from it!  I would recommend as a rental before buying.  You can beat this game in a day easily and the extra stuff you unlock isn't that great.</p>
<p>3/5 - Average.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>MGS2 left many people (including myself) feeling a bit awkward.  It was fun, of course, and sufficiently challenging, but there were some nagging issues:  (1) The abrupt and unfortunate switch to Raiden, a weak and shallow character, early on; (2) a lack of truly showstopping boss fights, and (3) a plot which was needlessly confusing and even illogical.</p>
<p>Thus, coming into MGS3, I had my doubts.  I feared that Kojima was suffering from the dreaded Lucas syndrome, and that Metal Gear was doomed to a long, ignominious downfall.  </p>
<p>Thank God, I was wrong.</p>
<p>MGS3 succeeds on so many levels.  The stealth gameplay has been further refined with the addition of close-quarters combat (CQC), which gives you more ways to deal with guards and bosses alike.  The graphics are stunning, as is the music (the import soundtrack is worth the cash).  But I'd like to deal with my three issues in depth:</p>
<p>(1) and (3) - Snake is your main man.  It doesn't spoil too much to say that this Snake is the man who eventually becomes Big Boss (and thus "Snake" is his genetic offspring).  He is a man who, in his own words (or at least a reasonable facsimile thereof), "Never had much interest in other people's lives."  This game is the story of his birth, so to speak, into the world as it actually is.  Despite his profession, he is an innocent, and his journey out of this blissful state is completely compelling.  As he leaves the graveyard at the game's conclusion, you realize you have come full circle in the Metal Gear mythos, and as such MGS2 makes so much more sense.  You understand why the Big Boss is who is he, why he did what he does, and his defeat at the end of the second game now feels tragic whereas before it just felt...like a let-down.</p>
<p>It's not too much of an exaggeration to say that I'm still thinking about MGS3's story months after finishing it.  It's that good.</p>
<p>(2) - The boss fights in this game KICK ASS.  Seriously, these are the best bosses in just about any game, ever.  In particular, The End is a vicious old bastard, and your battle with him may frustrate, but damn does it feel rewarding when you beat him.    <br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Three things:</p>
<p>(1) - The camera needs to evolve.  Perhaps Kojima should borrow a bit from RE4 - an over the shoulder view would make the experience so much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>(2) - At times, interacting with the game world is a bit too complicated.  I counted several times when I mistakenly fired off the wrong weapon just because the interface is trying to do too many things.  Ditto with CQC - I slit a few throats when all I wanted to do was drop a guard on his head.  Oops.</p>
<p>(3) - The much touted survival system (in which you must feed Snake and cure his wounds) is a bit of a distraction.  I had no real problem with feeding Snake, but curing him is silly and unrealistic.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Not just the best game of 2004, but an important milestone in gaming, period.  Hopefully, more designers will stretch the dramatic potential of games.  Only when this happens will this much-maligned medium attain the critical and cultural respect it deserves.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>Before we get to the review itself, I have a few announcements to make. Firstly, I haven't played any game of Metal Gear series before Snake Eater. Secondly, I have played a Subsistence version of the game, however, I had no interest either in multiplayer or in retro delights the package had to offer, and thus I will concentrate my efforts solely on Snake Eater. And last, but not least, Metal Gear Solid 3, for all its drawbacks, hasn't dissuaded me from trying other games in the series. The reasons to that fact are described below. </p>
<p>Approaching the game was a hard endeavor for me. Even although the first and the second game of the series have been released on PC, I've never really felt like trying them out. For some reason I always had enough games on my hands not to check out some obscure, unknown spy-games, that have presumably achieved a cult status on the consoles, which in its own right wasn't a praise for me at that time either. </p>
<p>Now that I have overcome my prejudices I brought myself to completing the PS2 exclusive third and closing part in the Solid trilogy, hailed to include the best series has to offer and pushing the corny plot of its predecessors on the new level of drama and emotional depth. After fourteen hours of playing I would only say that I can't imagine how awfully cheesy must have been the stories of two previous games to name the storyline of Snake Eater an improvement. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are plenty of good things to say about it as well. And I would like to start with... Intro.</p>
<p>James Bond has always occupied a special place in my heart. I've always enjoyed the opening credits for every new movie, with some lady with a good voice singing some obscure lines and abstraction paintings flying by in some kind of mix of female figures and gun/bullets shapes. Snake Eater starts on exactly the same note, prompting you to expect some excellent spy-thriller with fantastic production values, evidently capable to rival even the budget of recent Bond's movies. And it does not disappoint, at least partly. </p>
<p>Although, it fails to deliver the kind of suspense and thrill Bond movies were famous for, the amazing quality of the game is very hard to deny. Everything, starting from sounds and music and ending with cut-scenes direction and stunts is top-notch. Visually the game is very impressive. It's hard to believe that this kind of graphics is achievable on the PS2 hardware. Despite low polygonal count, clever use of lighting, textures and shader effects creates an illusion of a real next-gen title. It's quite a feat to be admired. </p>
<p>Since the better part of the game takes place in jungles one should expect a decent rendition of flora. And rightly so. Although not at the same level as <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=The+Elder+Scrolls+IV:+Oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> or <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Far+Cry">Far Cry</a>, the game manages to achieve the feeling of "plausible forest density" that even <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Vietcong">Vietcong</a> would feel rivaled by. Once again, nothing extra-ordinary, just some clever tricks, we perhaps should thank Konami programmers for, and not the artists themselves. </p>
<p>One wouldn't argue that the main strength of Metal Gear Solid  series lies not in the gameplay department, but in the one that deals with plot and narrative. So, what's the device that Konami and Mr. <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Kojima">Kojima</a> use to unfold their narrative? Nothing unusual, simple in-game cutscenes. Simple, you say? Wait, till you see the game. The cut-scenes here may be described by lots of different words, but "simple" is certainly not one of them. Unfortunately, the true genius of the game’s movie-like qualities truly uncovers itself only towards the end of it. Those among you,  who played the game immediately recognized what exactly I am talking about. Of course, I mean the exciting bike chase and all the events surrounding it. Intelligent use of camera, lighting, sounds and music provide one of the most exhilarating moments in the video games history.</p>
<p>But not merely a bike chase, every scene shows much effort put in it. And although it doesn’t work most of the times, it has nothing to do with the input of minor minds behind the game. Each of them has done his share of work adequately in the limits of requirements <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hideo+Kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> set, according to his personal vision. The vision, which, in the matter of fact…
<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>…sucks. </p>
<p>Yes, really sucks. Metal Gear Solid 3 story/plot/presentation is among the most ridiculous ones, if not <b>the</b> most. By the way, you can start counting the number of times I use the word “ridiculous” in the bad section of this review, because, I have a feeling that it’s going to be a pretty big one (number, not section). </p>
<p>All that is bad with MGS3 can actually be summarized in four words: characters, story, presentation and gameplay. Let’s go through these four aspects, one by one, ok?</p>
<p>Story. I am not sure if Mr. Kojima has opened a history book in a school, but this is the most inaccurate presentation of the Cold War ever. After this game everything <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tom+Clancy">Tom Clancy</a> outputs will seem to me as the most accurate historic truth, as it can possibly be. I could’ve really understood if there was an alternative history theme going on, but even if so, there’s absolutely no explanation for the some of the most inappropriate things. Portable bazooka-nukes, hover platforms, bi-pedal tanks, lighting-infused generals, fire-burning cosmonauts, Russian jungles (!) and lots of other things that are completely inadequate for the time epoch  the game chooses as its setting. The way the game juggles with the names of the known historical figures like <i>Khrushchev</i> or <i>Brezhnev</i> in the combination of pseudo-documentary shots doesn’t provide any historical authenticity either. Wait, there’s more. </p>
<p>The game’s story is guilty not only of being laughable, but of more serious crimes as well. It completely bogs down any emotional connection one might have established toward the events described in it. Really, how is it possible for a person like me to care either about Snake, Eva or The Boss, if neither of what I see happening before my eyes I can imagine being possible. All the plot twists exists only because of the flexible/ignorant attitude towards history. The defections as described in the game were not possible in the period of Cold War, at least not in the multitude as suggested by Konami. That in its turn eliminates the basic premise for a story or characters to exist and subjects every message the game might have tried (and in good faith it seems) to communicate to failure. </p>
<p>One could suggest not to take the story-part seriously. I would love to, really. Metal Gear Solid 3 would have made an excellent comedy adventure with its cartoon villains and spy wannabes. How does <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/289/monkey-island-2-lechucks-revenge/">Metal Gear Island 3: LeVolgin's Revenge</a> sound to you? Alas, the game obviously takes itself very seriously and offers no room for interpretations. </p>
<p>The truth is that all of those problems could have been easily overlooked, if the characters of the game were strong on their own, without necessarily being tightly connected to the setting. It saddens me that it’s not that close to the the truth either. It’s difficult to perceive Snake Eater characters as real people. They make a lot of unnecessary movements, gestures and the words they speak are those of 12-year old anime fan. How can someone be impressed with the stupidity and bland showing-off as shown by Ocelot. He’s the most annoying of the bunch, mainly because he appears for no apparent reason and all too often, without actually carrying any point to his presence in the game. </p>
<p>It doesn’t end there. Each member of the Cobra team is a new landmark in creating the most absurd and videogamish character ever. They do not, even in the least, fit into the game set in Russia during the Cold War, more so with the background given to them being… Wait a minute. Nonexistent.  Cobra Unit is something taken from the mind of the same 12 years old anime fan. Because even the real, good anime films, nowadays, do not resort to such kind of horribleness. </p>
<p>Major Raikov and General Volgin shows how little do people in Japan know about Russians. No, they don’t look like a cute anime-male character with white long hair and, no, they do not look like a walking conduits of electricity with unintelligible tattoos on their face. </p>
<p>However they do know how an average American secret agent looks like. No-nonsense kind of approach and a grim attitude. Snake doesn’t speak much, and, actually turns out to be a very nice guy until the moment he does start to speak. And, oh boy, where should I start? First, is it me or Naked Snake doesn’t know any other grammatical construction instead that of interrogative sentence? And if he doesn’t ask questions, he still sounds like asking somebody.</p>
<p>“We have deployed a nuclear device.” <br>
“Nuclear device?”<br>
“Yes, it’s located in Groznyj Grad.” <br>
“Groznyj Grad?” <br>
“Yes. Want me to show it on you map?” <br>
“My map?.. I mean, why should I trust you?”. <br></p>
<p>Well, you got the idea.</p>
<p>More so, the actor who did the voice-job for Snake is very good at only two intonations. They are very good intonations but voice-acting actually implies some acting, not just reading with the same voice regardless of their content.</p>
<p>And I am not even going start on the lack of  motivations or reasons behind Snake's actions.  His relationship (especially the way it starts) with EVA is clearly not a very good example of outstanding storytelling.</p>
<p>EVA. A good character, as far as you don’t look past the boobs, which Mr. Kojima, apparently considers to be the main character trait for his female characters. I agree, it worked for the first time, when she had half-naked herself for no apparent reason in the middle of the jungle. But really how much of the same boobs in the same bra can one actually take, before he starts to notice that the character itself is very flat otherwise. And again the overall irrationality, that dominates the game, shows it's nasty grin. There was simply no way for her to do all tricks she has done right under the nose of Volgin. It just doesn’t work that way in the world where villains are something more than boy-loving bastards in fancy boots.</p>
<p>And to finish it all – The Boss. The most applauded character at first appears to be very interesting and intriguing. But, as in case with Snake, it's just because she doesn’t get to speak much. When she actually does, she discovers herself not to be that much different from her colleagues. Her final speech is an incredible illustration of un-related banality disguised as a profound revelation. Of course, everything is relative on the war, but how does that explains your own situation, Ms. Boss? </p>
<p>The MGS3 characters have a nasty habit of talking too much without actual point to it. A trait not that uncommon to many Japanese games I’ve played. </p>
<p>But back to The Boss. The tragic story of this character is the centerpiece of the game. If it doesn’t get to your heart, Snake Eater is pretty much wasted upon you. This is my case exactly. Yet again the absurd and illogical storyline with the plot twists, being probable only if we assume the villains of the game to be complete retards, entirely eliminates any meaning, The Boss’s sacrifice was supposed to have. The Boss, regardless of her dim-witted name, could have been an excellent character. Not in this game, though.</p>
<p>Anyway, who actually cares about stories and characters in games these days? It’s a grit-teething gameplay that people want with breathtaking action and suspenseful stealth. Or <b>not</b> that breathtaking and <b>not</b> so suspenseful, as Snake Eater conveniently proves . While providing some interesting elements like healing system (similar to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Call+Of+Cthulhu:+Dark+Corners+Of+Earth">Call Of Cthulhu: Dark Corners Of Earth</a>) and eating/hunting twist, the game fails to offer anything that could have threatened established leaders of either stealth (<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Splinter+Cell">Splinter Cell</a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Thief">Thief</a>) or action (pretty much every other major game) genres. </p>
<p>Not to say, that gameplay is boring. Some sequences were, actually, quite enjoyable (the battle with an old sniper being the most interesting one) but the limitations the game self-imposes on itself can’t provide any twists, worthy of notice, to the already stale formula of either genre. Duck, stand up, shoot, duck. You won't find anything else to boil the blood or tickle the nerves here. Yawn!</p>
<p>And the last but not least, I don't like the games telling me that I am stupid. I like them to tell me that I am smart, agile, strong and very women-friendly. However, developers of Snake Eater have made a most inaccurate assumption that I am the same 12-years old boy, who barely knows what Russia is. All the common historic facts are explained over and over again, and the way EVA describes everything in the end for those "who hasn't figured it out yet" is simply distasteful and lacks subtlety, which is very important in these cases. 
<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br><b>Talent: 3/5</b></p>
<p><i>The team behind the game shows unprecedented skill and talent. Special mention goes to visual and programming folks, who achieved an impossible with the aged PS2 hardware. However, the game’s writing and story do not step anywhere outside the boundaries of everyone’s favorite 12-years old kid's imagination.</i></p>
<p><b>Ambition: 3/5</b></p>
<p><i>The game’s pretentious style and narrative, although failing to reach its point more often than not, is something I can respect. As they say, it’s a try that counts. However, the developers haven’t even ventured to do something interesting with the gameplay. So all the ambition was wasted on the cut-scenes, which is, as I have stated above, not such a bad thing either.</i></p>
<p><b>Pteity (Pushing The Envelope - ity): 1/5</b></p>
<p><i>A lot of games nowadays present great cutscenes. Some of them are better, some worse. But it takes much more than style and professionalism to make others follow you. It takes content and meaning to those stories you try to tell via your cut-scenes. And I don’t want to see any other game following in MGS3 footsteps in terms of its content and meaning. Gameplay distinctively lacks originality as well. So only 1 point for a little technical wonder this game represents.</i></p>
<p><b>Effort: 4/5</b></p>
<p><i>Once again, it’s evident that no one was trying to play a lazy dog. Everyone at <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Konami">Konami</a> did their share of work responsibly and with heart. Even <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Hideo+Kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, however far-fetched his ideas might be, obviously has put a part of his soul in the game and it shows. 4 points for effort, regardless of how misplaced it is. </i></p>
<p><b>Adequacy: 0/5</b></p>
<p><i>Nothing, I repeat, nothing feels right in this game. Characters -- speaking in nonsense and making over-exaggerated theatrical gestures without any point to them. Storyline -- bringing the word <b>ludicrous</b> a whole new meaning. Setting treatment that really makes me question the sanity of those responsible for the story in this game.  Everything is out of place and out of simple common sense. Oh... And did I mention that they actually expected me to collect green frog figurines (!) while on the mission? For God's sake! </i></p>
<p><b>Total: 2.2/5 </b></p>
<p>Some people might respond to this review with the accusations of lack of sensitivity on my part towards the culture not similar to my own, namely Japanese.  I have two things to answer to that. The first being that the game doesn’t deal with Japanese culture at all and the mere fact that the game was developed in Japan doesn’t give the developers an exclusive right to ridicule history and make characters behave like very bad Shakespearean actors.</p>
<p>And the second thing is that, in reality, many Japanese games actually <b>do</b> have a sense of reason, appropriateness and common sense. <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Shadow+Of+Colossus">Shadow Of Colossus</a> is a very recent example of that. And even <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> series , which also can be very inadequate at times, doesn’t fall to the point of being just plain stupid.</p>
<p>So how about that word I asked you to count in the beginning of the bad section of this review? Do you remember, the one beginning with “r”? Only one, you say. Well, it’s still enough to characterize Snake Eater most fully and comprehensively. </p>
<p>Ridiculous, indeed. Make it two.</p>

  <div id="trivia-text" class="text-break-word shrink-headings toggle-long-text">
    <h3>1001 Video Games</h3>
<p><em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em> appears in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Video_Games_You_Must_Play_Before_You_Die" rel="nofollow">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a> by General Editor Tony Mott.</p>
<h3>Camouflage</h3>
<p>Like <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/5211/metal-gear-solid-2-sons-of-liberty/">Metal Gear Solid 2</a> with its dogtags, Konami held a contest where people could send in their suggestions for custom camouflage, where the winners would have their suggestions incorporated into the game. A special facepaint can be earned by selecting <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em></p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>After the release of <em>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</em>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/50433/hideo-kojima/">Hideo Kojima</a> said that he would not direct this game. He wanted a member of his team at Konami to replace him, but none of them wanted to, so he was forced to change his mind and direct after all.</p>
<p>In an interview, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/52655/harry-gregson-williams/">Harry Gregson-Williams</a> jokingly said that he might return to compose this game's music "if it's set in the Amazon". At the time, Kojima actually was planning to set it in the jungle. Kojima decided to use this as a way to get Gregson-Williams to return; he told him that what he said had been the inspiration for the game's setting. He didn't tell Gregson-Williams the truth until the music was nearly finished.</p>
<h3>Ivan Raikov</h3>
<p>Major Ivan Raidenovitch Raikov is a mysterious character in <em>MGS3</em>. He speaks no lines during the game, but behind the scenes he has a whole background of history that shows that he is undeniably gay with Col. Volgin, the main antagonist of the game. </p>
<p>Raikov has man effeminate features in the games. Not only does he sport the soft feminine features of a woman and well-groomed body, but his voice in the English version is extremely high-pitched. </p>
<p>Any fan of the <em>MGS</em> series also will see that he is almost identical to Raiden from <em>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</em>. Not only does he look dead on like Raiden, but he also shares the same fighting style with him, and even has a poster of him in his locker. The name "Raiden" is even cleverly hidden in his name. Of course, Raiden was the infamous protagonist of <em>MGS2</em>, and today many debates rage on about his sexual orientation. </p>
<p>During cutscenes in the game, numerous references are made to Raikov and Volgin's relationship. When Naked Snake goes undercover, he knocks Raikov out cold and steals his uniform. When Snake is done taking off his clothes, he can be seen wearing a sporty thong. Then in another cut scene, Volgin grabs his crotch twice, and simply by feeling is genitals is he able to see through Snake's disguise, claiming "I know the Major better than anyone else." As well, during an earlier cutscene, the President is explaining that Volgin also goes by the name "Thunderbolt." If you take a look at Raikov when he's undressed, you'll see a thunderbolt right on the crotch of his thong. Also, because he is Volgin's lover, he subsequently has colonel-class authority even though he is only a Major.</p>
<p>The inside joke continues in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/21633/metal-gear-solid-3-subsistence/">Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence</a>. Subsistence contains a number of "outtake" videos done by the crew, and one of them is about Raiden who travels back in time in order to kill Snake and become the main character for <em>MGS4</em>. In one of the scenes, Volgin, mistaking Raiden for Raikov (since they look almost identical), tries to have butt sex with him. Raiden is then seen running out of the room with electricity shooting out of his backside. During the online play, Raikov's special move allows you to grab a soldier's crotch, which will stun them for a couple of seconds. He is also the only character in the online mode who isn't affected by pornography magazines, which normally "distract" the other characters for a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>Its not obvious, but the signs are undeniably there. Raikov is indeed having homosexual relationships with Volgin.</p>
<h3>North American version</h3>
<p>Additional gore was added to the North American version.</p>
<h3>PAL version</h3>
<p>There is exclusive content for the PAL version:
* Duel Mode - Battle through the game's Boss Fights independently
* Demo Theatre - Watch all the cut scenes in sequence
* European Extreme difficulty level
* 2 New Levels in Snake Vs Monkey Mode
* New Face Paint and Camouflage Designs not available in US or Japanese versions</p>
<h3>References</h3>
<ul>
<li>The codename of the character "Major Tom" is a reference to the 1969 song <em>Space Oddity</em> by David Bowie, which is about an astronaut called Major Tom. In the game, Major Tom is even asked "Can you hear me, Major Tom?" This phrase is part of the song's lyrics. Major Tom explains later in the game that his codename was taken from the movie The Great Escape. In the movie the prisoners had three names for the three tunnels they built, Tom, Dick and Harry. Major Tom explains that he mistakenly identified the tunnel named Tom as the one the prisoners escaped from. Tom and Dick were the tunnels that were discovered by the Nazis. Instead of asking Snake to call him Major Harry, he just shrugs it off and changes his codename back to Major Zero.</li>
<li>The date of the "Virtuous Mission", 24 August 1964, was Hideo Kojima's first birthday. It was originally 24 August 1963 (his exact birth date), but was moved up a year because he wanted the 22 November 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy to factor into the story.</li>

There are also figurines of Metal Gear REX, Metal Gear RAY from <em>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</em> and Jehuty from Zone of the Enders Z.O.E visible in the background, along with a photograph of Granin with his American friend (the grandfather of Hal Emmerich, Metal Gear REX's chief engineer in the original <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>).</li>

<li>If you call Para-Medic (SAVE) in the cave, you will eventually get on the topic of the 007 film <em>From Russia With Love.</em> You will be interrupted by Major Tom, who is evidently a big fan of the film. He'll even suggest a few hilarious Bond-esque gadgets to Naked Snake.</li>

<p>During some scenes in the game, Volgin ominously says the words "kuwabara kuwabara," a Japanese mantra which, according to Japanese superstition, will ward off lightning. This fits for Volgin's character, since his body uncanny electrical abilities, and he would superstitiously say the words to be safe from lightning that his body attracts. Volgin says the words whenever it starts to rain.</p>
