            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter (GRAW for short) is truly a nice piece of work. The graphics are amazing and the game is more fun than ever before. Below you'll see that I go into some detail about each section that should be reviewed.</p>
<p>Gameplay (Rating: 9/10)
The gameplay is wonderful with all the neat ideas they've put in. I never played Ghost Recon 2 because I wasn't too impressed with Ghost Recon 1 (except for the multiplayer, which was fun), but a nice feature in GRAW is the ability to go up to walls, vehicles, or other objects in the world and hide behind them. You just walk into them and it automatically "sticks" you to them; and then you can look over the top of the vehicle, or around the corner of the wall and shoot down the enemy, and then step into safety. Another nice feature is saving your men; if one of them is shot down, but not killed, you get a short amount of time where you can go up to them and "heal" them, this is especially helpful because sometimes, like in all games, the AI isn't too smart. One more nice feature that is new to the Xbox 360 is the Achievment markers that let everyone know what you've accomplished in the game, such as scoring 250 head shots in multiplayer (this makes you a scary individual for all those newbies out there).</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Rating: 7/10)
I was particularly impressed with some of the enemy AI; they find ways to hide from your HUD radar. One enemy saw me before I saw him and he just laid down and waited for me to walk right in front of him; as soon as I did, I was dead and he never showed on the radar, that was some great stuff.</p>
<p>Graphics (Rating: 9/10)
The graphics are amazing! The first time I blew up a tank I just said "Wow!" The explosion was huge and real looking with very nice particle effects. The people look real as well; if you get your man or one of your teammate's faces looking at the screen you will see how real their faces look. On top of that, the worlds look marvelous too. Another nice feature is the quick loading, their is a very short period where you can see that it's loading, but after that it loads a little while playing this in-game movie type thing that explains your next mission.</p>
<p>Audio (Rating: 8/10)
The audio is great. The voice acting is good for the most part, and most of the sounds in the game are incredibly nice as well. The soundtracks are definitely good; UbiSoft did a very nice job on those.</p>
<p>Multiplayer (Rating: 8/10)
Multiplayer has an awesome new campaign for players to play together. I've begun playing it with some of my friends and let me tell you, the co-op campaign in this game is awesome; you can't beat it.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Gameplay (Rating: 9/10)
Nothing I didn't like about the gameplay.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Rating: 7/10)
Most of your teammates aren't that smart but some of them are still good shots and have saved my life a few times. </p>
<p>Graphics (Rating: 9/10)
I didn't like the way the dirt looks; when it shows dirt or sand, the textures seem to be a little out of date; but this is only minor as the rest of the game looks great.</p>
<p>Audio (Rating: 8/10)
One thing that I didn't like is that I could've sworn I'd heard one or two of the sounds (like exploding sounds) in some older games I've played, but the lesser sound quality is barely noticeable.</p>
<p>Multiplayer (Rating: 8/10)
The only downside is that you're in 1st person view instead of in the 3rd person view (or 2nd person view as some might call it) which takes away some of the nice features in the game such as being able to hide well.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Overall Rating: 9/10
Gameplay is excellent, graphics are better, audio is great, multiplayer is totally cool; overall, it's a great game and I'd recommend it to anyone. I say, if you've got the Xbox 360 buy this game now, you won't be disappointed. If you're into the PC instead, definitely get this game when it's released.</p>
