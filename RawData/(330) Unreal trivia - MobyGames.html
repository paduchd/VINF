  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <div class="shrink-headings text-break-word"><h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>One of director <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=James+Cameron">James Cameron</a>'s pet projects after <em>Titanic</em> was an epic sci-fi extravaganza called <em>Avatar</em>, much hyped in Hollywood circles at the time and poised to redefine the notion of a truly alien world on the big screen.</p>
<p>The project fell apart initially, but the scriptment (a hybrid between a script and a treatment ) by James Cameron still exists. Interestingly, you can find quite a few similarities between it and <em>Unreal</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both feature a basic plot premise where, by virtue of circumstances mostly beyond his control, a reluctant hero becomes the saviour of the native race of an alien planet forced to mine their land for ore of utmost importance to an invading race coming from the skies. In both cases the saviour is seen by the natives as someone who also came from the skies and is thus initially met with some alarm or distrust only to be later hailed as a pseudo-messiah.</li>
<li>The native race is called "Na'vi" in <em>Avatar</em> and "Nali" in <em>Unreal</em>. The physical description of the Na'vi by Cameron can be visualised as basically a cross between the Nalis' tall, lean, slender bodies and the IceSkaarjs' blueish skin colour patterns, facial features, ponytail-like dreadlocks and caudal appendages.</li>
<li>The Nali in <em>Unreal</em> worship goddess Vandora. The home planet of the Na'vi in <em>Avatar</em> (which the Na'vi worship as a goddess entity) is named Pandora.</li>
<li>In <em>Avatar</em>, one of the most dazzling alien settings described is a huge set of sky mountains, "like floating islands among the clouds". One of the most memorable vistas in <em>Unreal</em> is Na Pali, thousands of miles up in the cloudy sky amidst a host of floating mountains. The main sky mountain range in <em>Avatar</em> is called "Hallelujah Mountains". The main <em>Unreal</em> level set in Na Pali is called "Na Pali Haven". Both include beautiful visual references to waterfalls streaming down the cliffs and dissolving into the clouds below.</li>
<li>The Earth ship in <em>Avatar</em> is called "ISV-Prometheus". One of the levels in <em>Unreal</em> takes place in the wreck of a Terran ship called "ISV-Kran". Even more striking, in the expansion pack <em>Return to Na Pali</em>, the crashed ship the player is asked to salvage is called "Prometheus".</li>
<li>One of the deadly examples of local fauna in <em>Unreal</em> is the Manta, essentially a flying manta-ray. In <em>Avatar</em>, one of the most lethal aerial creatures is the Bansheeray, basically a flying manta-ray. The expansion <em>Return to Na Pali</em> even features a Giant Manta, while in <em>Avatar</em> one of the most formidable predators is a giant Bansheeray, which Cameron dubbed "Great Leonopteryx".</li>
<li>In the two stories (especially <em>Return to Na Pali</em>, on <em>Unreal</em>'s end), a plot point arises from the fact the precious ore behind the invasion of the planet ("tarydium" in <em>Unreal</em>, "unobtanium" in <em>Avatar</em>) causes problems in the scanners.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Unreal</em> was in development for several years before its release in 1998. The <em>Avatar</em> scriptment was probably finished as early as 1996-97. Bearing all the above in mind the temptation to start wondering about further suspicious parallels may be quite strong, but in spite of these similarities both titles have few else in common and many aspects actually veer off in wildly different directions. Even so, the coinciding factors can make for an interesting minutia comparison.</p>
<h3>Bots</h3>
<p><em>Unreal</em> was the first FPS shooter to official include Bots, A.I. characters which mimic the actions of live players during multiplayer deathmatches. Although previously fan-programmed Bots had been created for games like <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Quake">Quake</a> and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Doom:+Evil+Unleashed">DOOM</a>, <em>Unreal</em> was the first game where the Bots were officially included by the game's programmers.</p>
<p>Many features of the Bot A.I. were used to program the A.I. of the game's single player enemies, particularly the Skaarj. As a result <em>Unreal</em>'s single player enemies had a degree of flexibility previously unseen in their ability to fight, manuever and navigate levels.</p>
<h3>Combined attack</h3>
<p>The "combined attack" mentioned in the manual applies to the shock rifle. Fire a plasma blob with the secondary fire button, then, without moving, fire a shot with the primary fire button. The shot will pierce the plasma blob in midair, exploding it (with a nice blast radius).</p>
<h3>Cover art</h3>
<p>The reason the jewel case is so prominently displayed in the box design is because there were four different jewel case cover designs, all of them screen shots (look carefully at the second box scan and you'll see "Actual Gameplay Screen (2/4)"). This was a clever way to show off the game's graphic superiority.</p>
<h3>Cut features</h3>
<p>Some <em>Unreal</em>-Previews in 1997 told us about some proposed features which didn't make it into the final game. For example: - the character can morph to four other shapes - you can build your own deathmatch-arenas and - connect them via Internet. So you can - walk from one Deathmatch-Arena to another via teleporters...</p>
<h3>Eightball</h3>
<p>The eightball weapon in the game is called like that because it originally fired 8 missiles. Play testing revealed 6 made a more balanced weapon, but the name stuck.</p>
<h3>Engine</h3>
<p>The <em>Unreal</em> engine had a unique feature. It could render using DirectX, OpenGl, and Software Mode. It even included support for 3dfx Glide drivers. Most 3d engines before and since only support DirectX or OpenGL, but not both. It took 4 years to design. It had several features that weren't included in the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=%E9%9B%B7%E7%A5%9E%E4%B9%8B%E9%94%A4II">Quake II</a> engine:
* Volumetric Lighting: An effect for generating fog, smoke or plasma. It was used in great effect for obscuring view.
* Dynamic Lighting: A real time render of colored lights. You could mix colored light sources to produce other colors. You also could see moving shadows</p>
<h3>German version</h3>
<p>Violence was reduced for the German version of <em>Unreal</em>. The "reduced gore" option is missing from the menus, enemies simply disappear instead of being gibbed, and severed heads also vanish instead of flying through the air. </p>
<p>But most notable are changes to the opening level: Corpses and blood stains were removed as well as background sound effects and scripted fight scenes - drastically changing the game's atmosphere. Some pain screams and similar background sound effects are also missing in later levels.</p>
<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p><em>Unreal</em> has a lot of "scene" tricks, like colored lighting, dithered texturing in software for 8-bit displays, XMs/ITs for music, music from scene musicians, and other engine enhancements. The name "Unreal" is the same name used by a pioneering demo from Future Crew.</p>
<h3>Microsoft</h3>
<p>The game's technical advances at the time attracted so much attention that even <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/376185/william-gates/">Bill Gates</a> himself requested a meeting, in absolute secrecy, with the developers of <em>Unreal</em>. The meeting took place in early 1997, but by that time GT Interactive had already acquired publishing rights for the game.</p>
