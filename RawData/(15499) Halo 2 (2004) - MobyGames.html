    <p>In the sequel to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/5368/halo-combat-evolved/">Halo</a>, Spartan-117, better known as the Master Chief, has returned to Earth, where he is promptly needed: despite all precautions taken, the Covenant have discovered the location of humanity's homeworld and are launching their attack. For some reason, however, their fleet is much smaller than expected. To solve this mystery, the Chief must return to the stars, learning more about the mysterious Halo rings and their constructors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Covenant Elite who commanded the fleet at the Halo construct is blamed for the destruction of the ring and branded a heretic. The High Prophets grant him another chance, however: he is made the Arbiter, a special operative for the Prophets, ordered to carry out impossible missions. He will be dealing with dissent and rebellion among the Covenant - a conflict where he might find himself to be on the wrong side.</p>
<p>The player controls both the Chief and the Arbiter in <em>Halo 2</em>, a first-person shooter in the same style as the first game. Its main gameplay characteristics are the same: only two weapons can be carried at a time (leading to a tactical choice as to which are to be taken), instead of a standard health points system there is the recharging energy shield (leading to an emphasis on finding cover during firefights), AI-controlled teammates will fight along with the protagonist, and there are lots of sections involving vehicles.</p>
<p>New features include the ability to double-wield certain weapons, doubling the firing rate at the expense of accuracy, and the ability to execute melee attacks or throw grenades. Part of the weapon arsenal is unchanged from the first game, but there are also some additions. The human projectile weapons are mostly new and include a pistol, shotgun, SMG, and battle rifle. Returning are the sniper rifle and the rocket launcher. The Covenant energy-based weapons (still prone to overheating) from Halo all return, and new additions include several heavy hitters like the Brute Shot and Fuel Rod Gun along with the projectile-based Carbine and the Beam Rifle, both useful for sniping. The Energy Sword is a powerful melee weapon, able to kill most enemies with a single strike.</p>
<p>All vehicles from the original game also return: Warthog jeeps and Scorpion tanks for the Humans, Banshee fliers, Ghost gliders, and Wraith tanks for the Covenant. A new addition is the Covenant Spectre, which with its rear-mounted cannon wielded by a dedicated gunner is comparable to the Warthog. A new player ability concerning vehicles is to board them while in use and either kick off the driver and take over or in the case of heavy tanks, throw in a grenade.</p>
<p>The multiplayer component of the game has been greatly expanded. On the Xbox, Xbox Live is now supported in addition to split-screen and system link. The campaign can be played by two players on split-screen. Competitive game types include Slayer and Team Slayer (standard free-for-all deathmatch), Capture the Flag, Assault (planting a bomb in the enemy base), Territories (controlling sections of a map for a certain amount of time), Oddball (finding a skull on the map and then holding on to it as long as possible) and more. All types have several built-in variants and can also be customized further. Players can choose from Spartan and Covenant Elite skins. The PC version comes with a map editor.</p>

This phenomenon grew into tournaments where contestants have won up to $50,000. Halo has definitely earned that kind of popularity.

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>Okay so Microsoft decides to release a game which was outdated since its release. Yes, outdated on release! </p>
<p>Halo 2 was released in 2004 for Xbox and that year the PC had titles like Half Life 2, Doom 3 and the outstanding debut of FarCry. </p>
<p>There are few good things about this game. It's A.I is pretty impressive even with current standards. Some of the weapons are fun like the battle sword. Not to forget the dual wield feature was integrated with the mouse controls perfectly(carry two different one handed weapons).  The overall production quality is good &amp; multiplayer is promising.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>The single player campaign could have been more interesting if it had more depth. The gameplay is equivalent to an old arcade game. Its basically run and gun everything, occasionally drive vehicles. Think Painkiller with vehicles but not as enjoyable, insane or good looking.</p>
<p>The movement and control is a disaster. Still the same slow paced gameplay. Not to mention the zoomed in field of view(FOV) is back, what i mean is you keep getting the feeling that your weapon is zoomed in a bit. This was just making my head pain.</p>
<p>The graphics are okay for 2004 standards, but for 2007 its horrible. Not to mention the bad porting which was done. While games like Half-life 2 and Bioshock run fine on my PC with everything turned up  Halo 2 tends to stutter or even lag at times. </p>
<p>Last but not least this game is a Vista exclusive, that means it doesn't work on Windows XP. I find this decision pointless as the game doesn't even use DirectX 10 nor does it do anything to at least  enhance the graphics a bit. It does utilize "Tray And Play" which is a new Vista feature where you can play the game as it installs and Windows Live.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Over hyped and Overrated is the only way to address the newer Halo games. The only reason Magazines and sites give this game a high rating is to avoid conflicts with the "fanboys". While this game is below average overall, i would still recommend it to a person who is new to gaming or First Person Shooters as its very basic, bland, easy to understand and got pretty good production.</p>
<p>And should you upgrade to Vista for this? I wouldn't recommend it if you're solely doing it for this game but hey its your choice.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>Since this is Halo 2  the game is very, very, well made, such as the graphics engine and will get you well immersed. I like how the soundtrack is done, a very, symphonic music, mostly in a rock kind of way. also the design and game plot is well planned out, their are many features in the game like hijacking vehicles or duel-wielding making you addict on the game for hours. But their is to much stuff in the game for me to explain, overall you NEED TO BUY THIS GAME!!! IT IS THE BEST!!! Oh, and character design can't be ignored, the Master Chief talks more, and even Elites talk! which puts you more in depth, I am finished with the positive side of the game because I don't want to spoil anything for the newbies.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>The End. End of the Halo story, which is kinda disappointing because their will be no other halo games going to be made! Sorry if I broke your heart. Sorry peeps.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Bottom line is the game going to be a big-time award winner, the game is good for new players too because if you play it on easy, it's easy, Overall the best game, graphics, sound, design, the works, this is a must for everyone, especially for the ones who have Xbox Live because Live support is awesome, now this is a mighty game so buy it, gear up Master Chief!</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>(Review for the single player campaign, normal difficulty.)</p>
<p>The best Gamepad support ever in a computer game. It feels just like a console game. If you just wanna play Halo, there's no need to buy an Xbox anymore. (But you will wanna get an Xbox 360 after this, because Halo 2 is so good, you will wanna play Halo 3 and Halo Wars.) The length is just right, not too long. The final level is challenging, with a memorable final boss fight. Overall, the normal difficulty is entirely reasonable, and never frustrates you, and you never get stuck at one point for very long. You NEVER need to read/watch any walkthroughs. The paths and what you should do next are entirely clear to you.</p>
<p>Dual weapon wielding creates some frantic battles. The firepower is doubled, and enemies die so much faster. As a result, they throw more enemies at you, expecting you to use the dual wielding ability to fight them off. The dual-Needler is the most useful combination. The action is so intense and fun. When you are wielding two weapons, you can still reload your guns with just one button, and it's a lot of fun watching your character do that, even though it makes no sense at all. (You only have two hands, so how are you able to reload without dropping a weapon first?)</p>
<p>Halo 2 is actually shown on the HBO series The Wire (I think it was season 4). There's some poor black kid playing the game at the end of an episode. It's not such a bad neighborhood after all huh?</p>
<p>Two best moments:
- Driving a tank across a bridge, with your team launching an epic attack on this giant, futuristic-looking building. After playing this, I won't need to travel anymore. I got the best view in the world right here on my computer screen. It felt like the end of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Walking through a long tunnel. I walked for about two minutes with no enemies at all. It was a quiet, minimal, and mesmerizing experience. It's two minutes of peace during times of war. It changes you. I think everyone should experience two minutes of spiritual serenity everyday, as demonstrated in this particular level of Halo 2.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Halo 1 didn't have any faults, and Halo 2 managed to introduce quite a few.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you play as the Arbiter, some of the enemies (Covenant) in Halo 1 will become your allies. But it's not really easy/possible to tell which monsters are your allies. You'll end up shooting your own teammates a lot. This is the biggest problem in Halo 2. It feels horrible. I already killed a lot of those monsters in Halo 1, and now that they've become the good guys, I still keep shooting them. I can't forgive myself for this.</p>
<p>Too many weapons. The new weapons are mostly awkward to use. The balance is gone. In Halo 1 every weapon was necessary and useful. In Halo 2, some weapons are never useful. The best weapon from Halo 1 (Pistol) is gone, and replaced with a much inferior model. It's like your girlfriend who is a 9 is gone, and your current girlfriend is a 5. I want my 9 back. The fuel rod gun is the only new weapon that's good. It's a huge gun with a lot of destructive power.</p>
<p>The "health" bar is gone. You only have a shield bar. No more exciting moments when you discover "oh my god there's a med kit here! I can replenish my health!" Now, you can replenish your health at any time, as long as you're not being attacked. This really takes the thrill and anticipation away.</p>
<p>The "stealth" element is a bit lame and unbalanced. The Arbiter has the ability to cloak. Very cool and useful. During some levels, you can choose to kill all enemies, or you can just walk right past them and still able to get to the next checkpoint. Why put those enemies there at all then? Since first-person shooters are all about shooting, killing, explosions, I wanna kill my enemies. I don't wanna skip them and still be allowed to proceed. Halo 2 sometimes encourages you to skip the enemies, which is against the nature of FPS lovers.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>If any game developer was wondering why their game didn't sell as many copies as Halo 2 did, I'll tell you why. It's almost certainly because Halo 2 was more fun to play. </p>

  <div id="trivia-text" class="text-break-word shrink-headings toggle-long-text">
    <h3>1001 Video Games</h3>
<p><em>Halo 2</em> appears in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Video_Games_You_Must_Play_Before_You_Die" rel="nofollow">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a> by General Editor Tony Mott.</p>
<h3>Cheats</h3>
<p>Since its release in November of 2004 <em>Halo 2</em> has been plagued with many forms of cheating. It started with gamers discovering that if they pushed the "standby" button on their modem it would allow them to move about the game doing anything while everything else was frozen. Later on the "Dummy Glitch" was discovered where players could turn invisible and capture a flag without the opposing team even knowing. In April 2005 Bungie released a patch that completely got rid of the Dummy Glitch and made it so that using standby was much harder and only a small percentage of modems can still use it to manipulate the game. All seemed well but unfortunately in June 2005 people with Mod Chips in their Xbox found out that because the downloaded content maps were stored on the Xbox hard drive rather than the disc that it was possible to hack them and use special cheats in the game. Examples of these cheats are the "Super bounce", Super speed, Rapid fire, Needlers that act as rockets, auto aim snipers, and many others. Most of these issues were eventually dealt with through patches.</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<ul>
<li>The development team included 70 people.</li>
<li>Microsoft lawyers forced Bungie Studio to change the name of the alien antagonist because it carried Muslim overtones.</li>
<li>Contains 17,000 lines of combat dialog.</li>
<li>Just like in the first <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Halo">Halo</a>, <em>Halo 2</em> also has a weird enemy that's been hidden in the game's code. It's called the Juggernaut and it can only be found using a modchip. It looks much like the Engineers from the first <em>Halo</em>, except it looks more like a flood. It just floats around.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Leaked Copy</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, 13 October 2004, a pirated copy of of the game leaked out to the public, and quickly spread on peer-to-peer networks and IRC. </p>
<h3>References</h3>
<ul>
<li>The hippo heads that appeared on the shotgun shells in the first <em>Halo</em> are visible on the walls in the map "Headlong".</li>
<li>The <em>Halo</em> maps "Blood Gulch" and "Battle Creek" return in this game under the new names "Coagulation" and "Beaver Creek".</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sales</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the US and Canada alone, 2.4 million copies of the game were sold in the first 24 hours of its release. That averages out to roughly 27 copies a second.</li>
<li>Had 1.5 Million preorders before its release, making it an XBox "Platinum Hit" months before it was even released.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soundtrack</h3>
<p>The game's soundtrack includes contributions from legendary guitar legend and G3 member <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/13915/steve-vai/">Steve Vai</a>, who performs most guitar riffs in the game and did the main theme. You can find his work in the Halo 2 , Vol. 1 Soundtrack CD, which includes all of the orchestral and incidental music in the game.</p>
<h3>Secrets</h3>
<p>Right at the end of the game there's a grunt that doesn't do anything, its just like the grunt from the first game except it says: "I wish that food nipple was waiting for me at the starship, cos man have I worked up a big grunty thirst"</p>
<h3>Trailer</h3>
<p>The largest trailer for this game was released in movie theaters. Near the end of this trailer, the usual <a href="http://www.xbox.com" rel="nofollow">www.xbox.com</a> URL is replaced with "<a href="http://www.ilovebees.com" rel="nofollow">www.ilovebees.com</a>" for a moment. If someone goes to the website, they encountered a website which seemed to be under the control of a Halo-type artificial intelligence. This website continues to be changed, telling a multifaceted story which many believe explain how the Covenant find Earth in <em>Halo 2</em>. </p>
