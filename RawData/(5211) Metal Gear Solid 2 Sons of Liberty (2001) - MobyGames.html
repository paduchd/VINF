    <p>In 2007, two years after the Shadow Moses incident, Solid Snake - now working for a freelance organization known as Philanthropy - infiltrates the oil tanker U.S.S. Discovery, investigating the development of a new Metal Gear-type weapon. A confrontation with a Russian military group as well as an old acquaintance from Snake's past adventure leads to a massive detonation, after which Snake is presumed dead.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the year 2009: the player takes control of Raiden, a rookie agent operating under the order of the Colonel, apparently a member of a reformed Foxhound unit. His initial assignment is to infiltrate the offshore clean-up facility Big Shell and rescue the President of the United States of America, who was kidnapped by members of a terrorist organization known as Sons of Liberty. However, the matters become increasingly complicated as almost everyone Raiden communicates with appears to have a hidden agenda, and it is hard to tell a friend from foe...</p>
<p><em>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</em> is the sequel to the espionage action game <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=metal+gear+solid"> Metal Gear Solid</a>. Much of the gameplay remains the same, as the game's protagonist has to sneak past guards, outsmart them using various gadgets, and defeat the tricky boss enemies. There are a host of weapons to be picked up throughout the game, some old, such as the FAMAS and Socom, and some new, such as the AK-47. Martial arts combos can be used to disable guards. It is possible to crawl through small spaces, peek around corners, and perform acrobatic leaps to get away. The protagonist can also hang from railings, effectively hiding from guard, or stick his gun in a guard's back, surprising him. The cardboard box is also back, and can once again be used for hiding. </p>
<p>Gadgets such as sneak suit, mine detector, thermal goggles, and others can be found along the way.. The radar from the original game is still there and alerts the player to guards' positions and also shows their field of view. If an alarm is sounded the radar is disabled while the hero has to escape. In some situations, it is necessary to enable the radar before it becomes possible to use it.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, the game is heavy on codec conversations and cutscenes. All the cutscenes in the game use the in-game 3D engine; the characters' movements are motion captured animations.</p>

These are the games that not only surpass almost every game on the market, but also bring with them several groundbreaking ideas that will no doubt be emulated countless times in the future.

I purposefully didnt discuss the story much because I think, for all its structural flaws, it provides an experience that is infectiously insane. I doubt this is the sequel Kojima and his co-writers had in mind when they wrote Metal Gear Solid, but thats precisely what gives it its maniac energy. In a very Hitchcockian gesture Kojima structures the entire game around a plot twist no one will see coming and many might not even like.

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>I've played Metal gear solid, I was heavily impressed by it's bold steps and mix of action and tension. I heard about the craze this game always had in game events such as E3 etc..
Remember that literally millions of people wanted to have this game on its first day of release, so, I remember what the first game was like, and I got exited too!
I was very lucky to buy this in the U.K a day before its release and payed a hefty £45.99 for it! 
"but why would you pay that much?!" ... well, the original game was THAT good!</p>
<p>I certainly loved the presentaion of this game! It, simply, shines with a difference of quality like a big budget movie.
The soundtrack paces this game correctly. I have studied music and have produced similar lines of such sounds like in this game, and, I have to say..... NICE!
When I entered a room after being hunted by guards, I felt the tension was definately held by it's precise score (and me reacting with the words "man, that sounds nice" helped too)
Harry Gregson Williams did the musical score (and also for such films like The Rock) and, I can honestly say, that he wasn't chosen for having a popular name!</p>
<p>It's something you should experience yourselves, as is, with most of the rest of the game.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>This game is so plot driven, it's like watching a movie.
Maybe a bit TOO much movie! Theres definately a lot to accomplish in the game and a great addition to the series.
It's a shame that I think of it as just an 'addition' instead of a game of it's own.</p>
<p>Please don't get me wrong on this, but the games creators sole idea was to have the main character for the first game seen in a different perspective.</p>
<p>To me, personally, it was as if the second James Bond movie, was about someone else's encounter with James Bond, and not about bond himself... and I really wanted the main character back!</p>
<p>I am definately a fan of the games director and creator Hideo Kojima, and this game was a totally cool seeing Snake strut his head-banded stuff as you played the role of another character.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, this game is definately plot driven and to review it for gamers who like all types of games is quite a challenge!
This game has some amazing graphics! Maybe not AS interactive as it should, but there is plenty to feast your eyes on, even birds taking a dump from above!
(It's actually good to think of a games charming points, that being,  a bird dumping , even as anticipated a game as this.. the creator did not let up the chance to have a bit of gameplay humor!)</p>
<p>Deep down though, throughout the game, after the first 'quarter' I was itching to play as Snake again. 
Also I wont spoil the plot by revealing too much about the charaters..
So I will just mention the game itself...<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>This game is top, top, top of its class! Without a doubt, I can't stand games when the developers stick a stealth bit in for no reason if it wasn't meant to be for it's first outing (such as the tomb raider series went..)
I don't mean to beat up Tomb Raider, because I was a mega fan of the first Three games!
But that just proves how to go about ruining a successful game by changing and experimenting too much.
I am glad to say Metal gear does not do it this badly!</p>
<p>Ok, maybe I'm being a bit too harsh, I rate things always as a first hand experience, I feel sometimes, with a great game (thought of maybe like a favourite basketball team) being up top with the best for years, then,  patiently you support it and see it tumble.
For me, thats how I personally feel about the Tomb Raider series..
But who knows, many people are bound of not to of seen that 'basketball team's early years before and are now expriencing their new way of learning from past mistakes!</p>
<p>For example.. For people who have never played Metal Gear before, You are definately going to be impressed by this game, long cut scenes and all!</p>
<p>There are some amazing points in here which keep you wanting to visit again, such as, getting ALL those dog tags!
In this game you can do loads of stuff (respectfully) with knocked out bad guys!
You can drag, drop, hide and....um... drag some more!
There's nothing more satisfying in this game than dragging around a guy who's been shooting at you and finding you out for 20 minutes! (ok, maybe shooting watermellons is just as much fun too..)</p>
<p>Yes there is alot of story to follow in this game. I found myself waiting for a cut scene to end to save and finish for the day, and ultimately being drawn into playing for "just another 5 minutes".
I just loved sneeking around the place too much fun! And to have it stopped by 10 minutes of chatter was a bit annoying when I was geared up for action!</p>
<p>The game always leads up to a point your going to have to be ready for, (such as the great introduction to a boss fight!)
Metal Gear Solid 2 Sons of Liberty is a top quality game!
But the thing is, 
you're going to have to experience this one for yourselves to find out if you like it or not.</p>
<p>p.s If you're going to pay £45 for this now.. don't, you can find copies everywhere for at least £20 because people are buying the re-make of this game and it lets you play snake all the way through!</p>
<p>The definate bottom line is... if you have played the first one and haven't played this, get Metal Gear solid Substance! Because it's the same game and more!
But if you are a fan, get this!
Remember, this game was made by Hideo Kojima for a reason, and that reason was to creat a more varied world of Solid Snake.
But we wouldn't be human if we couldn't critisize!</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>First of all to say, I'm a huge fan of animations and CG in general (sometimes even 2D ones, like in "Outlaws"), and this game gives you plenty of those. But that's not the point with this game, 'cos it was quite the opposite case. Real-time rendered animation are wonderful, but what I was eager in waiting was the time I'll be playing after each of those semi-longer breathtaking cutscenes. Yup, ingame quality is so well done that I enjoyed it as much as watching cinematics. Also, the thing was that they were all in real-time and not pre-rendered and then just saved as animation (more about that later). And those textures were so fantastically glued to the objects and polygons that it all looked as real, and gave you a feeling of watching some action movie.</p>
<p>Since I've mentioned ingame was even more taunting than watching cinematics, let's say a few words on that one, now. You move from third-person perspective, which varies (sometimes it looks almost as top-down, and sometimes quite up front, depending on the camera position, and if the current location scrolls along), and you can do quite a nice set of moves while in that mode. You can flip over the fence until enemy soldiers pass, hide in the locker, shoot around (while shooting in 3rd-person view mode, it gets something like shooting in those horror-survival series), fight, drag an enemy soldier, walk with box on top (now that's a great one, hehe), crawl (though that sometimes automatically switch you to first-person view if you're in the tight area that cannot be reached or seen from atop), use the corner view, and more. Now, for the precise shooting, you can also switch to first-person mode. While in it, you can do alsmot everything the same (except walking), but it's rather hard to fight in it, since when you make a circle strike, you turn for 360 degrees and get lost, hehe. Switch between the two modes is really wonderful, as all those texture at up-close look really great. Let's say a word or two about game parameters now.</p>
<p>You can set a few types of radars to have, and change more basic options than you'll need, from vibration to whatever I forgot right now. Also, when you finish the game (originally you play as Raiden), a new chapter opens that you can play, a 'Tanker Episode' which happened two years prior to game's story, and you play as Snake. There's one thing really interesting to observe while playing, and that's the enemy AI. For example, I was entering a small portion of a computer room that had two way of getting out. After the reinforcements were summoned upon, three of the guards spotted where I have entered. Now, in some ordinary mumbo-jumbo action shooting game, they'd just rush and there'll be some major shooting upon. But no, these just splitter and one sneaked from the each exit of where I was, while third one was staying outside in case I escape somehow (and that is when you play on Very Easy level, on European Extremely Hard, only difference is there are more soldiers, and game may over as soon as you're spotted). I saw everything form top-down at that part, so it's nice to observe them in action whenever you can. You can also try to distract some guard by knocking somewhere and then head the other way, pretty neat altogether, and I barely counted a few nice tricks this sequel possesses.</p>
<p>Going onto audio discussion, music is wonderful. It reminds a lot on music from "The Rock" movie, partially 'cos Harry-Gregson Williams was one of three who composed for that movie, but what Hideo and his team planned, and I'll say achieved, this does altogether bare a resemblence to some Hollywood action movie, only it's far better. While we're talking sound, I must say that no matter speech altogether was nicely done, sometimes it really looked awful. For example, Raiden sounding like a girl whenever he yikeses or sighs (it was enough for him too look like a girl, already), or the part Otacon was crying, even child would notice how much faked that was. But maybe original japanese version was better acted, I dunno. Japanese trailers look good, though, hehe.</p>
<p>Atmosphere was really nice, I especially liked all those women posters and pictures around the game, hehe, if that cannot increas the atmosphere, I dunno what can ;) Plus, effects and character movements (both your and enemy's) look so real you can't help but thinking it <em>is</em> real. Now to mention that real-time rendering thingy this game has. That is best shows after you finish the game entirely, both chapters, you get 8 cinematics from the game to watch, in which you can change character roles. For example, what in original story was Snake, you can put Raiden, Fortune, Snake form the original "MGS" or someone else instead. The model will change, though the voice will stay the same, since it's recorded for the game as it comes originally. The advice would be to replace female characters with such and male ones with such, then voice acting won't sound too strange, hehe.</p>
<p>This was somehow my first "Metal Gear" game I've played (seems I usually start most of series with sequels, hihi), so I didn't know what to expect quite, and I was expecting some game sorted by the missions. So basically, I thought that 'Plant Episode' is just the first mission, since it didn't seem as it can hold the whole story and characters I've previously seen in trailer. Boy, was I wrong on that one! The game is on the same place over and over, and you just can't get enough of it. You constantly discover new places, new perspectives, and story unfolds almost entirely on the same place. I admit it fascinated me how they made an un-boring game almost entirely on the same place. And it's not as short as other people say (well, at least not if you don't skip cinematics which are half of the game by themselves, hehe).</p>
<p>I've seen so many great games for PC, and just a week ago, I would swear that no console can have a better game than a computer. Well, the thing I realised is that consoles do not make games by themselves, it's the poeple that counts. Konami sure pulled this ace wonderously up its sleeve, and showed how making so many details and carefully planned points for ingame playing (even if they will be used couple of seconds) is more than appreciated. With this engine and everything, I bet they could increase number of levels, rooms, enemies and everything by a far which would make us play for over 80 hours, but would that still count as a quality then? By playing this game, you can always expect something new, especially after each of two endings it has.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Yeah, right!</p>
<p>Actually, there is one thing. Hideo obviously tried to go on player's feelings when entering certain real-life videos and create something more than a documentary, something that would make us 'think' or that would sound more deep. Well, it's all a pile of crap. If it was animated, I couldn't care less. That ending really wasn't as expected as I thought will be. Endings doesn't need to be too long, but do need to be animated or using something that's part of a game's creation. It would be just enough for the screen to go blank after the final epilogue (that animated, I mean), and wee see the credits with the final song. Or maybe that final song would get more to expression if it would be in the background to the final animation, like the one in "Final Fantasy VIII".<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>It all sums up to that this game does not lack in almost anything. Well, that 'almost' can be replaced with 'time only', but if we'd be playing each game for weeks (like that "Planescape: Torment", or when I was playing "The Secret of Monkey Island" while I was 10, so it took me 2 years to end it, whereas it doesn't take me more than one day now), we'd miss all those new releases every now and then, wouldn't we? Well, actually, I can just say "everything that's good doesn't last too long", but then again, there's so much of the good stuff that it makes an endless array, so it does last.</p>
<p>This game has couple of nice factors. It manages to surprise you with the plot twists, and its plot is really kewl enough as if you'd watch some action movie. Doesn't stray too far away. The graphic is simply and art, an art achieved with the right textures at the right place. The music is great (especially the main theme), though speech could've been better (I've only played english version, though). The level of details and things you can do simply go extreme. It's not as if you can do everything you wish to, but in a simple way, it could even be put as that.</p>
<p>Now, I dunno about the first "MGS" (yet), but this game puts you in a role of a young lad, a FOXHOUND agent who is sent on a mission to rescue the president from the hands of yet unknown soldiers. However, you were trained for field action, but only in VR (or have you never tasted blood?), but seems you have a point-blank about your past. And what you considered as just dreams may be the reality you played your role in. Snake appears in this episode but only as your 'ally', not a character you can play with. However, once you finish the game (the one with Raiden), you'll get opportunity to play with Snake the "Tanker Episode" which happened two years prior to the game's original story, and experience what you though of a background story all along.</p>
<p>Alltogether, this game will give you about 12 hours of playing with Raiden and 2-3 hours of playing with Snake, and that is if you do watch all animations, but also do just as you were told to, and not snooping much around. It's a worthy experience though, helped me consider console game quantity doesn't much matter if there's a quality. Hey, this worked for me, and I love the game, but if you really dislike to see animations or listen to dialogues every now and then, then pass it by.</p>
<p>Oh, almost forgot. Yeah, this PAL edition, SE, whatever, comes with an extra "Making Of" DVD. For those curious enough, that DVD contains some half an hour long commentary of making of the game with Hideo Kojima and some other developers, some art concepts, bunchs of "MGS" and "MGS 2" trailers (on japanese, though), and trailers for some other Konami games ("Silent Hill 2", "Shadow of Memories" and few others). It also has some minor additions, but these are not worthy mentioning, and you'll know why when/if you get this game. Well, as the woman's voice tells you at the sole start, "Enjoy!" :)</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>MGS2 is a very different game, and while it still feels similar to its predecessor, the improvements are instantly noticeable. The core gameplay is just as good as it ever was - tactical stealth action where careful planning and imagination are rewarded.</p>
<p>Enemy AI is vastly superior to the original, and enemies no longer spawn infinitely, but a skilled player can even shoot their way out of a sticky situation, but staying out of sight is still recommended. The difficulty level is just right and there's plenty of gameplay variety, keeping the game interesting throughout. The game is also at least twice as long as MGS1, yet all of it was enjoyable. Even the mandatory shooting segments feel better than before, as you can individually target enemies' heads for quick kills or cripple them by shooting their arms or legs.</p>
<p>Compared to other games of its time, MGS2's graphics are gorgeous, despite the overuse of the color orange. The characters are human, but thanks to subtly cartoonish design, avoid falling into the uncanny valley. Voice acting is good, and even the worst pieces of dialogue are acted convincingly. The music is gorgeous too and makes the game sound like a high-budget Hollywood movie, but sadly the soundtrack still doesn't quite compare with MGS1.</p>
<p>The story is definitely something you either love or hate, and there's no denying that the cutscenes and Codec calls are far too long. But still... few other games have made me laugh, cry, cheer and cringe so often. Every character plays an important role and they're all fascinating in their own way, hero or villain. The plot also handles many themes completely unprecedented in video games, such as censorship, the nature of memes and information, mortality, atonement, child soldiers and so on. While most action games outright glorify violence without a second thought, the Metal Gear series is openly pacifistic, while still delivering its message in a package with lots of explosions and sexy characters. The ending, while it may seem like a mess to some, is very thought-provoking and atmospheric, definitely one of the best in video game history.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>It's not just that the cutscenes are much longer than necessary - there's also too many of them. For example, you may step into a  room, watch a cutscene, walk a few steps, have a largely pointless Codec conversation and watch another cutscene before you an actually play. Most of the game's dialogue is redundant, pointless, unnecessary, filler and did I mention, redundant? Other times, the game is melodramatic beyond belief and scenes that were supposed to make me cry or gasp in shock sometimes made me laugh or roll my eyes. There's also an endless amount of exposition and explaining, which seems to be typical for a Japanese game.</p>
<p>Apart from the opinion-dividing story and characters, MGS2's flaws are minor. The game could have used better controls and camera angles, especially in the mandatory shooting segments, where you can't actually move when firing while in first person, though just the fact that you can do so is an improvement from the previous game.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Metal Gear Solid 2 is an original, well-made, challenging and thought-provoking stealth action game. The slight hiccups in game design never manage the ruin the big picture, so as long as a slightly pretentious story doesn't cause problems, the game is definitely something everyone should try at least once.</p>

  <h2>Trivia
    
  </h2>
  <div id="trivia-text" class="text-break-word shrink-headings toggle-long-text">
    <h3>1001 Video Games</h3>
<p><em>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</em> appears in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Video_Games_You_Must_Play_Before_You_Die" rel="nofollow">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a> by General Editor Tony Mott.</p>
<h3>Action figures</h3>
<p>Just as for the original, a line of action figures has been released by McFarlane Toys. Most of the main characters are depicted and as an added bonus each individual figure comes with a part of the new Metal Gear. Collect them all and assemble the monster!</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>The development budget for <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> was somewhere in the region of 10 million US dollars.</p>
<h3>Ending</h3>
<p>Pretty soon as the game starts and you get used to controls, you are requested to enter your name, date of birth and such things (like in some typical Square RPG games). In the ending animation, when Snake asks Raiden about that dog tag he's wearing, Raiden looks at it, before he throws it away, and in that cinematic, on a dog tag, you see your name and info. </p>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>On the opening of the game, there's one piece that somehow does not fit the game without any explanation. First, we see some roman letters (numbers) etched on stone, then we see some Japanese ink writings on a paper, and then we see programming data and computer code. <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/50433/hideo-kojima/">Hideo Kojimo</a> commented how that was to show the advance of civilization from storaging data. First through stone, than using paper, and the least digital data which is the only that doesn't have its existing time period. And that is then connected to the game and especially Arsenal Gear as an AI with great capability to track, store and control data.</p>
<h3>Making of</h3>
<p>On the <em>Making Of MGS2</em> documentary that comes on an extra DVD, Hideo Kojima said that idea for <em>Metal Gear</em> series originated from his playing 'hide and seek' with his son.</p>
<h3>North American version</h3>
<p>In comparison to the Japanese version, some extra gore was added to the North American version. In the <moby game="Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance">Substance re-release this was revoked.</moby></p>
<h3>Raiden</h3>
<p>In order to cover up the character Raiden, the promotional trailers for the game showed several scenes with Solid Snake in different scenes. In the final game, Raiden is involved in the same scenes, but in Snake's place. Hideo Kojima used computer tricks to cover up Raiden and no one knew of his existence until the game was released. However, the manual spoils the surprise on its very first pages.</p>
<h3>References</h3>
<ul><li>Just as in the original <moby game="Metal Gear Solid">Metal Gear Solid</moby>, a poster for Hideo Kojima's previous game <moby game="Policenauts">Policenauts</moby> can be found in the Computer Room in the Shell 1 Core.</li><li>If you look quickly in the scene where Snake logs into the computer to send the pictures to Otacon, you can spot another reference to <i>Policenauts</i>.</li><li>During the game, you will come into contact with a man named Pliskin who is actually former protagonist Solid Snake in disguise. The name is a direct reference to "Snake" Plissken, the main character played by Kurt Russell in John Carpenter's movies <i>Escape from LA</i> and <i>Escape from New York</i>.</li><li>A crazy Bomber man, one of the bosses is named Fatman. That was also a name of one of the atomic bombs that fall onto Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</li><li>The names of the characters Jack and Rose were taken from the main characters of <i>Titanic</i>. This film also influenced the decision to set the first chapter of the game on a sinking tanker.</li><li>emma's nickname (E.E.) and full name (Emma Emmerich-Danziger) are references to E.E. Danziger, a character in Jack Finney's novel <i>Time and Again</i>.</li><li>In the flooded basement of Shell Core 2, you can find a rubber duck floating harmlessly in one of the air vents. While it's possible that it's just a humorous detail, it's most likely a reference to the original tech demo for the PlayStation 2 which featured a rubber duck floating in a tub.</li></ul>
<h3>Series</h3>
<p>In a Gamespot interview done shortly after the finishing of the American release, Hideo Kojima has amended a former comment about <i>MGS2</i> being the last installment, saying, "I really think that Metal Gear has to live on in some form. But as I said at the end of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, I really think it is time for me to hand the director role over to someone else. I might do the initial planning for the next game but not much more than that."</p>
<p>He goes on to mention that the future of a certain character who is disliked in some gaming circles is still uncertain. 
 
</p><h3>Soundtrack</h3><p></p>
<p>Due to the success of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, the development team had a higher budget for the sound of the game. However, they didn't know who they would hire to compose the score for the game. One day, executive producer Hideo Kojima and sound director <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/52654/kazuki-muraoka/">Kazuki Muraoka</a> went to see <i>Replacement Killers</i> at the cinema. They both liked the movie a lot, and the music from the movie seemed pretty good. So, they flew to US, and got <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/52655/harry-gregson-williams/">Harry Gregson-Williams</a> to make the score for <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i>. They actually took his music from other movies, such as <i>The Rock</i>, <i>Enemy of the State</i> and some and put on one CD, and told him they'd like to make this video game with a Hollywood type of soundtrack. He also saw the interest in composing for something before he actually saw the picture, since when composing for movies, he always got inspiration from the pictures. And so the soundtrack for <i>MGS2</i> was created.</p>
<h3>Women</h3>
<p>Looks like developers of <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i> had focused minds on some things while making a game. You open a locker, you see wrapped up posters of a women, you enter the dining hall, you see framed pictures of women in swimming suits. There is even a poster of the <i>Charlie's Angels</i> movie in one room.</p>
<h3>Working Title</h3>
<p>During development, the game was originally going to be called Metal Gear Solid III (MGS3 for short), which would have completely skipped over the second installment of MGS.  This can be seen in the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/79761783/Metal-Gear-Solid-2-Grand-Game-Plan" rel="nofollow">Metal Gear Solid 2 Grand Game Plan</a> by Hideo Kojima.</p>
