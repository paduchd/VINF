    <p>The peaceful Sulabacca island of the slime kingdom of Sulan has been invaded! All 100 of the inhabitants of the island have been kidnapped by the Shippo Dan. You alone remain to save all of the villagers from their grisly fate.</p>
<p><em>Slime MoriMori 2</em> has you trekking through various dungeons in search of kidnapped slimes. Your slime can hop around, float across chasms and attack using its own body as a weapon. By stretching itself and then releasing, the slime flings itself around like a rubber band, attacking enemies and ricocheting off walls. This same move is used to strike items and rescuable friends. Either the item or friend is launched into the air, so you can catch them and carry them to a safe location. The dungeons are very reminiscent of those you might see in a classically-styled 2D <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3393/the-legend-of-zelda/">Legend of Zelda</a> game filled with a variety of enemies and focusing on puzzle-solving to get through them.</p>
<p>In addition to this, at certain times, you must defend yourself from attack by using your Slime Tank. Battles here consist of loading your tank with ammunition that falls from chutes, and firing the ammunition to attack your opponent, or to block your opponent's fire.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>Very addictive, simple control gives enjoyable gameplay, very quirky and funny!<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>A little predictable at times, only has one save file.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>The town of Boinsburg is under attack! Giant metal balls are destroying the buildings and every slime except for Rocket has been captured in treasure chests. The Plob has taken over Slimenia and is trying to get rid of slimes all together. How can you save your slimey friends?</p>
<p>As Rocket, you go around Slimenia looking for the treasure chests that contain your slime friends. Then you pick them up and throw the on the TranSlimenian Railway to send them back to town. The main point of this game is to repopulate Boinsburg (the Slime's town) with your slime friends as well as collecting as many objects and monsters as you can.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime has so many different things to do in the game that It's gameplay is just amazing. It was based off of Zelda games, so it is a little simplistic and easy to pick up and learn; however, that's what makes the gameplay so much fun. There's the normal attack which is called Elasto Blast, but as you go through the game, you realize exactly how much you can do with just this one attack. Because of the Elasto Blast, you can put things on top of your head to carry. There is an extremely large number of items and monsters you can put on your head and what makes the game even better is that some objects do different things when you throw them off you head. The heavy weights shake the ground and flip some monsters over; Chimera Wings fly objects or monsters back to town. However, will all of that just by putting things on your head, there are also Tank Battles you have to play! These are quite fast paced and very fun. You use objects that you have collected as ammo to shoot at the enemy tank. Not only that, but you can shoot yourself, your friends, or your enemies out of the tank as well. You can infiltrate the enemy tank and destroy their computers. This is one of the best parts of the game. The tank battles provide a lot of fun as well as a good challenge. You can customize your ammo and upgrade your tank and you can play the tank battles as much as you want until you are satisfied. You also get items for replaying tank battles so that you still get rewarded!</p>
<p>Tank battles can be quite challenging and whereas it's rather difficult to actually die, the tank battles actually are hard to win. The difficulty of the puzzles in the game are somewhat easy as well but they do make you think about what you're doing.</p>
<p>The soundtrack to the game is very fun. There are tracks that will give you nostalgia to the older Dragon Quest games, but there are new tracks that you love to listen to play for hours. There is one track that is a little weird because of the vocal noises that are played in it, but it fits the situation that it plays in. The music adds to the enjoyment of the game as well as the immersion into the Dragon Quest world.</p>
<p>The storyline is rather simplistic, but it's the simplicity that makes the game amazing. Even though the storyline is basically rebuilding the town, there are conflicts and different situations that add more depth than you would think out of such a cute game like this. Overall, this game is very addictive just because you want to collect everything. I actually got stuck playing this game for 4 hours straight before I realized that I had homework to finish. Even then, I didn't to put it down. There are great little references in the game to pop culture and other video games. One of the tanks that is a tree is named "Chrono Twigger." The small little Easter Eggs like this just make you smile. This game is filled with comedy and it's overall a very enjoyable game. This is a treasure that might be buried in the DS line-up and it's much better a game than it comes off as. It lives up to the hype it had and the high reviews don't lie. This game will make you addicted to it where you'll want to play it every chance you get. I never played my DS on the train before until I got this game. I just couldn't go that long without playing it!</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>The way the controls were set up.  The story of the game.  The stages and the way that even doing the same thing never got old.  The tank battles by far are the best aspect of the game since you throw items you collect in a cannon and watch in fly to hit the other tank.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Too easy, and also it was Way To Short.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>You play as rocket a slime who must go out and rescue his other 100 friends.  You use the a button to attack, jump and float.  The b button tosses, and picks up.  You go through stages looking for monsters and items to throw on the carts.  When you run into a slime you also throw those on carts.  The items you throw on carts help you in tank battles.  The monsters once you get 30 and the musuem you will get to use them as team members in tank battles.  The game focus on easy gameplay and fun humor. This is one dragon quest game you should not be without</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>After a few hours of playing this game I am very happy to have bought Rocket Slime. The game has some old school elements that Dragon Quest fans will pick up on right away along with some new things as well that new fans will enjoy. The game play is cute and very entertaining as you control one of Dragon Quest’s most famous monsters, a slime. The slime’s name is Rocket and it is his job to save 100 of his townspeople who are also slimes from the “Plob”. The Plob is a mafia type group run by Don Clawleone. 
The control of the game is fresh and entertaining and takes only a few minutes to get acquainted with the basic controls of Rocket. Rocket is able to pick up objects to throw them, smash into them, and also float around. Rocket can also unlock and explore a cute little world filled with creatures. 
Another really fun aspect to the game is the Tank battles. These battles are very entertaining as you take your tank, The Schlieman Tank and battle various members of the Plob on your quest to save your fellow slimes. You use ammo that you collected from dungeons and such and control Rocket while shooting 2 cannons at your enemy. The tank battles also use items you have found and or created in the game using alchemy to combine items into more powerful items. The tank battles also have a fun multiplayer option to battle your friends and their own tanks. 
The graphics in Rocket Slime are not pushing the envelope for DS capabilities but and great none the less. This game is perfectly suited for the DS and I could not imagine this game being capable on any other system. 
Sound/music in Rocket slime is very cute and upbeat. Fans of the series will notice little chimes and sounds from previous DQ games. The sound does a good job in playing on the feel of the moment and is the type of music that you will catch yourself humming though out the day! 
Overall the game is very entertaining and a great addition to the Dragon Quest series. You meet lots of cute characters, the story is filled with a little bit of humor and subtle clichés, and the look of the game is a welcome addition on the DS. If you are a fan of the Dragon Quest series, Zelda (Yes I did say Zelda) or just looking for a great little adventure game you owe it to yourself to pick this game up! On a score from 1 to 10 on this game, this game gets a solid 9.0. 
<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Collecting items and monsters at times is a bit repetitive and it seems to easy to get items to use for the tanks. <br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>If you enjoyed Zelda for SNES you should like this game. It is similar minus the swords and shield. A great game none the less. </p>
