    <p>Freed by the decree of Uriel Septim VII, the Emperor of Tamriel, a lone prisoner is transported to the province of Morrowind. It seems that the strange dreams this prisoner has been having lately may have a connection to equally strange events occurring there. The protagonist is given a simple assignment: join the Blades, a secret organization whose goal is to protect the safety of the Emperor. This leads to a discovery of an ancient prophecy and an evil scheme concocted by a powerful deity whom the protagonist alone is able to stop.</p>
<p>Conceived in the tradition of the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> series, <em>Morrowind</em> is a fantasy role-playing game with a vast world open for exploration. After being released from a prison ship at the shores of the island Vvardenfell, the protagonist may do more or less what he or she wants: follow the main quest and solve the mystery of an ancient prophecy, join any of roughly a dozen guilds and rise in their hierarchy by performing duties, or simply explore the gigantic island with its stylistically diverse cities, hundreds of dungeons and tombs, ancient ruins and mighty fortresses. </p>
<p><em>Morrowind</em> uses a two-stage skill system. The hero’s primary stats (strength etc.) increase with each level gained, while secondary abilities improve by use – for example, the more often the character jumps, the more proficient he or she becomes in the Acrobatics skill, etc. The action-oriented fights are simple exchanges of strikes or spells, until one combatant dies. The enemy's hit points and condition were not originally shown; however, at the request of customers a health bar was added for enemies as part of the first upgrade patch.</p>
<p>The protagonist's race and gender, but also his or her reputation influence the reactions of NPCs. If a character’s sympathy for the hero is low (rated on a scale from 1 to 100), he might refuse to answer questions; if it is high, the player will get more detailed information and better bargains in shops. Most quests involving other persons can be solved by persuasion, pick-pocketing, or simply by force.</p>
<p>The game's NDL 3D game engine is powerful in drawing wide, detailed outdoor landscapes as well as complex indoor environments. Transitions are not fluent; houses and dungeons must be loaded upon entering.</p>

Morrowind is elegant, enormously detailed and full of extraordinary stories (to say nothing of the construction set that allows you to make your own). It\u2019s well worth the time and energy it takes to unravel it, and the results should satisfy most gamers. Morrowind still suffers from an occasional lack of direction, but it\u2019s intentional; players who need to be told where to go and what to do will not always find such assistance, although the product is much more approachable than Daggerfall. The only real problem is its reliance on a dated RPG system that almost always degenerates into a close-range click-fest. Bethesda has mastered the art of storytelling and worldcraft; they need only work on the core RPG system, and then they\u2019re sure to produce a classic.

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>...and nothing more to it, really. Granted, a walk like that can be fairly interesting for a while, much like being in an enigmatic dream that may or may not just turn into a nightmare. Thus your walk may be intriguing up to the point that you visited all the highlights, set pieces like 'The Quiet Fishing Village', the 'Dark Foreboding Tomb', 'The City With The Weird Architecture' and so forth. But then you realize that this is a 'hands off' kind of theme park, there are no interactive elements; sure, you can enter the caves and houses but their residents are the dullest androids ever, each repeating the same lines. Sometimes radio-controlled creatures seem to attack you but they feel fake and out of place. You soon feel that you had enough; it's one lifeless, soulless park.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Morrowind just doesn't work as a game. Without repeating all the agreeable criticism of the previous reviews I'll just emphasize what is possibly the ultimate cause of the title's failure: stock dialogues. NPC conversations are normally the life and soul of an RPG and these were removed due to a highly regrettable design choice. Either that or Bethesda's complete lack of writing skills and NPC-related imagination. Was Ultima7 the last game that got it all right?..<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Here's hoping that Bethesda learns the error of their ways and Oblivion will actually be an enjoyable role-playing game with unique, believable NPCs.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br></p><p>
The first thing that strikes you about Morrowind after a few hours of play is the sheer enormity of the game world.  There is a LOT to do, but the game starts you off with very little clue about <i>what</i> to do.  For some gamers (like myself) this may be a dream come true in gaming: a huge world to explore and complete freedom to do as you please.  For other gamers (like a few friends of mine), this is a complete gaming nightmare.  "You mean I have to wander around for hours and explore and talk to people just to figure out what the point of the game is?!?!?"  Yes, you do, but if you can appreciate that sort of depth in an RPG, it is truly a wonderous thing to behold.</p>
<p>
Let us talk about the degree of that depth for a moment.  When I say you can do as you please, you really can.  Feel an item at a shop is too expensive?  Steal it (if you can get away with it).  Don't want to help the arrogant noble woman find her way across the mountians?  Don't bother.  In fact, you can just kill her and steal her clothes if it strikes your fancy.  Don't feel like coughing up a handfull of gold every time you want to stay at your favorite inn?  Murder the innkeeper and his guard, and stay there free of charge as often as you please.  All these actions, of course, have consequences.  You have a reputation rating, based upon your actions, and that rating affects how NPCs in the game will react to you.  Most people won't want to talk to 'Entorphane the notorious outlaw', but will be much friendlier to you if you don't make a habit of running around killing people and generally wreaking havoc.
</p><p>
So what <i>is</i> the point of this game, you ask?  Well, you are a stranger in a strange land; a prisoner granted an unexplained and unexpected pardon from the Emperor himself.  Soon you find yourself working for the Blades, the Imperial spy network, and the story unfolds from there.  In addition to the Blades (the so-called 'Main Quest') there are a large number of other factions, guilds, and mafia-style family houses you can join the ranks of.  All of these other factions have a fairly large number of missions to perform, given to you by various faction leaders scattered all around the map.  You can do them or not, the choice is up to you, but as you complete missions for the various factions, your rank in those factions rises, eventually allowing you to vie for their leadership.  By the end of my game I was the head of the Mages and Fighters guild, and ranked very high in a family house and several other groups.  
</p><p>
A wonderful and somewhat unique feature of 'Morrowind' is the ability to create custom magic spells and magic items.  You can enchant almost any item you find with any spell you know (if you have a high enough enchatment skill), allowing for the creation of just about any custom magic item you feel you may need.  The process is somewhat confusing at first (thanks to the somewhat lacking manual), but once you figure out what is going on, it's awesome.  Want a ring that allows you to breathe and see clearly underwater while you are wearing it?  That's cool, just make one, or go to an enchanter and pay (a LOT) to have one made.  It's a marvelous feature, that later in the game especially, allows you to create a wealth of magic armor, weapons, and so forth, all with precisely the effects you wish them to have.
</p><p>
The skills system in this game is great as well.  It's very simple, and very effective.  You have a skill list and all characters have the same skills.  The difference lies in what you choose for your primary and secondary skills (which level up faster) and your tertiary skills.  Every time you use a given skill (hit an enemy with a sword, cast a spell, pick a lock, etc.) your skill goes up a bit, eventually rising to it's next level.  When you raise 10 primary or secondary skills by one level, your character's overall level increases, bringing along with it the usual upgrade in hit points, magic points, and so forth.  It's a very well thought out system, that ends up allowing you a tremendous amount of freedom to mold your character into precisely what you want him or her to be.
</p><p>
It must be said also that graphically this game is most impressive.  Look at the water.  It looks freakin' real, I tell ya!  The sheer amount of detail in the game is amazing.  Everywhere there are plants and fungi you can gather (for alchemical purposes, if you want to make potions).  There are dozens of caves, tombs, and ruins scattered all over the map to explore and loot for treasure.  The weather and time of day changes gradually and you make your way around.  Sunsets and sunrises are truly beautiful, sandstorms are amazing to look at, and rain storms look and sound like real freakin' rainstorms.  <br><br>**The Bad**<br></p><p>
The game is not without flaws, some of them glaring.  The worst offense is the journal that you keep.  It is cluttered, disorganized, and confusing.  When you are running missions for the Theives guild, the Fighters guild, the Morag Tong, House Hlladu, the Mages guild, the Blades, the Imperial Cult, the Temple... whew, you get the idea... things can become <i>confusing</i>.  All of the relevant information is there in your journal, but it may as well not be.  The journal is organized chronologically... period.  There is no option to sort between quests completed and quests outstanding, no way to separate Mage Guild quests from tribal quests, or what have you.  If there is a mission that you received a long while ago, and you need to look it up for the details, you will sometimes (especially late in the game) have to flip through literally hundreds of pages of the journal to find the relevant information.  I have to give a big 'boo' to that tremendous lack of foresight by the developers, who obviously knew the depth of the game they were creating, yet failed to devise a method to effectively sort through that depth.  
</p><p>
Another complaint has to be the spell/magic items list.  Much like the poorly organzied journal, these important spells and items are placed on one very long list that you have to scroll though every time you want to select a different magical effect.  It's tedious and irritating, and should have been made easier.  
</p><p>
It must also be said that the combat system leaves a lot to be desired.  By default you press the attack button and will swing your weapon in a manner that is dependent upon how you are moving your analogue stick.  There is a most powerful attack for each type of weapon, but attacking this way feels awkward (to say the least), uncomfortable, and frustrating.  I opted to select in the options menu to 'always use best attack', which always attacks in the most powerful style for any given weapon.  Sadly, this greatly simplifies the animations for each weapon, as you will ONLY attack in one specific way (i.e. your dagger will always thrust, your hammer will always strike downward, etc.)  The other problem with combat is the complete lack of feedback regarding enemy damage.  You can hack away at a guy (or monster, or what not) for days, and see no change in his appearance, no indication of how badly he is injured.  This diminishes the ability to use strategy in battle, because if my character is badly injured I need to know how the other guy is doing before deciding if I should finish him off or run away.  One may argue that hit points are not displayed in real-life combat, but you can tell by how much the other guy is bleeding and missing limbs how well (or poorly) things are going.  
</p><p>
There are a few other minor gripes I have about the game.  NPCs are almost always in the same spot, standing around, night or day.  It is as if you are the only person in Morrowind who moves around much.  There are also a few bugs relating to event timing and NPCs that can cause them to disappear entirely and permanently.  There is no abilty to annotate the map, which is unfortunate considering the size of the map, and the HUGE number of places you need to find and remember the locations of.  Having to walk all over a virtual world can kinda suck at times, especially early on when a few cliff racers can send you to your death over and over and over and over again, when all you want to do is get from point 'A' to point 'B'.  There are modes of quick transportation available, but you can't get everywhere from anywhere, and you'll have to 'change busses' quite a bit.  The final complaint I have would be that your character can become immensly powerful relatively quickly, making killing most enemies a matter of a few sword swipes (especially if you have created a really powerful magic sword).  Oh, and pop-up can be distracting, considering the games otherwise top-notch graphics, but that is really just a minor complaint.<br><br>**The Bottom Line**<br></p><p>
'The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind' is a game I would consider a must buy for any gamer who prefers a PC-style RPG over the turn based Final Fantasy style crap that keeps being turned out for consoles.  It's a very deep and satisfying RPG, if you can get into it, and are willing to spend some time with it.  It can probably be completed in about 40 or 50 hours if you rush through, but it took me probably closer to 200, and that is where the real pleasure in this game lies.  There is so much to do, so much to explore, and so much to learn about the virtual world that you are inhabiting, that taking your time and taking it all in is the best way to approach it.  If you are looking for a unique roleplaying experience, this is your game.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>STORY
You are a captive, onboard a slave ship that has docked at the Island Vardenfell...off the coast of Morrowind. Having no idea what you are doing here you must start off greenlimbed and form a life for youself in this new world.</p>
<p>The main story also revolves around a few aging gods, plots to end the world amongst other many many sub plots...</p>
<p>GRAPHICS
Probally some of the best I've seen for a RPG...there's so so so much detail in this game - and if you have a good graphics card to boot - well you're in for a treat!.
Firstly the island is chock full of details - you are not just wandering around a blank plain with a few trees here, a rock there...no you are wandering around an incredibly varied enviroment that is filled with many sights and sounds...from giant mushrooms, to rolling hills...it's pretty much all there (save snow and forests).
There are plenty different races living here and each have their own style of accomodation...Some races like the Imperials live in large impressive fortresses that dot the sky, others may live in the ancient massive city of Viviec where the tiered cantons reach into the sky...or some choose to grow their homes out of large impressive fungi.
The details on these dwellings is very impressive...from the simple Tudor style house to the massive intricately twisted and spirialing plant homes the textures are just incredibly done, the same goes for objects and characters. Each character has a different face...though some faces are more commonly repeated - mainly on guards...and some races don't have many faces to choose from...which kind of spoils it a bit...also there are different hairdos for each race as well that adds to the viarity.
Lighting is also well done, there's just something wonderful about seeing the sun slowly set and the stars comeout...you can even see the birth signs in the night sky.
There's just so many more things graphcially that make Morrowind so wonderfully immersive...you can't really explain them all.</p>
<p>GAMEPLAY
Ok this is very different from most other RPGS...other RPGS offer the usual - kill more things...get experience...Morrowind...does it differently...the more you use a certain weapon the more skill you get with it...after you fill around 200 experience points of whatever (be running, using a sword...etc) you gain a level...it's a bit confusing.</p>
<p>Acessing something is done by using space, attacking is by the right mouse button...then comes accessing the inventory..
The inventory, map and stats are all one one screen...this is really irritating because there's not much room for it all - unless you are running the game at a high resolution. It would have been better to have the map and so on a different button.
Sword fighting is a bit too dull - you move in a direction and you strike in a direction - a but too limited in my opinion - and it's made even more limited by ticking the "best attack" option in the menu.</p>
<p>AI is pretty lax...they either attack when provoked, or just attack...no real tatics involve - just run up and whack the crap out of the offender. Also the crime system is a tad weird as well...when you loot or kill someone - you can either pay the guard, go to jail (lowers experience) or fight (making yourself an outlaw).The things to do in Morrowind is large and plentiful...you can even become a vampire - adding a twist to the game as you can only travel at night - and most people want to kill you outright.</p>
<p>There are many many quests that you can partake on - and some are simple, others are just weird...but all really involve just either killing someone, or retreving an object (usually by killing someone). There's alot of walking involved as well, while there is transport to and fro areas...most of the time you are on foot power...which comes to another game flaw...you walk like you have had your legs bound! It's very slow and irritating...even when you're constantly running.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>It's hard to get into. You start off with no idea what to do...or really where to go, not many people like you, and you have next to no cash...and you just got beaten up by a rat.
Also the scope of Morrowind is just massive, there's so many things to do in the game it's just crazy...and you kind of get bored in the end because you end up doing so many side quests that you never get around to the main story.
Also the Journal is just not very well done. It records many little notes and conversations in there and is a good book of reference...but...it gets too messy fast and you are constantly flipping backwards and forwards trying to find information about something...there's an index - but that does not really help as well.
Also the game is bit of a resource hog...after a while the game starts to slow - so you have to close the game to clear the memory a bit. Also the game is prone to just crashing...no warning...just <em>click</em> boom back to desktop...which is very annoying if you have not saved.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Morrowind does have a few weird gameplay flaws in this in comparison to the other RPGS out there...but there are so many things to do in this game world that you will rarely get bored.</p>

  <div id="trivia-text" class="text-break-word shrink-headings toggle-long-text">
    <h3>1001 Video Games</h3>
<p><em>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</em> appears in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Video_Games_You_Must_Play_Before_You_Die" rel="nofollow">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a> by General Editor Tony Mott.</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p><em>Morrowind</em> is told to include 3244 NPCs, 316.042 hand placed objects, 480 billion possible characters to create and play, 150 billion spells by using spellmaking in the game, and six full sized novels worth of text.</p>
<h3>Creature differences</h3>
<p>Some monsters and creatures went through drastic visual changes from <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/778/the-elder-scrolls-chapter-ii-daggerfall/">Daggerfall</a> and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1579/an-elder-scrolls-legend-battlespire/">Battlespire</a> to <em>Morrowind</em>. First, the type of khajiit are the same as those presented in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/972/the-elder-scrolls-adventures-redguard/">Redguard</a>, while the Dremora were turned from fair-skinned, horned demons to black and red-skinned demons. Harpies were replaced with (visually at least) Winged Twilights, and other monsters such as the slaughterfish, orcs and others remain much the same, though much better looking in true 3D.</p>
<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p>Ever wonder why <em>Morrowind</em> can run at such a slow FPS sometimes and why the game is notorious for making even expensive, fast systems (as of 2004) seem slow? The answer is simple; polygons. While playing the game you'll encounter vast areas full of people, objects and architecture. All these are made from polygons and require the videocard to process them. <em>Morrowind</em> has possibly the heaviest counts of polygons in a single video game, most likely surpassing every game before it and still with a vast number more than contemporary games.</p>
<h3>References</h3>
<p>There is a single daedric crescent from <em>Battlespire</em> hidden in <em>Morrowind</em>, but getting to it requires some work and initiative (it isn't a part of any main or faction quest), or access to a hint guide.</p>
