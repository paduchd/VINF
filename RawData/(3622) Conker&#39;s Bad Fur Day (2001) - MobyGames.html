    <p>Conker the Squirrel has had a really bad day. Too much partying, too much booze - and the result is predictable: a terrible hangover. What is less predictable, however, is the fact that Conker has no idea where he is. All he wants is to go home to his girlfriend Berri, but it seems that an unknown force has thrown him into another world. The ruler of said world, the dumb, but vicious Panther King, is having a serious problem: he has been just drinking milk when he discovered that the table in his throne room is missing one of its legs. Unable to solve the problem by himself, the enraged monarch sends for the mad weasel scientist, Professor Von Kriplespac, who suggests a red squirrel as a replacement for the table's lost leg. The Panther King sends his minions after Conker, who has to explore the bizarre world, deal with its eccentric characters, stay alive, and find a way to return home.</p>
<p><em>Conker's Bad Fur Day</em> is a grotesque counterpart to Rare's own cheerful, child-oriented 3D action platformers (such as for example <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3583/banjo-kazooie/">Banjo-Kazooie</a>). Intense swearing, violence, and instances of "toilet humor" co-exist with cute animals and a brightly colorful fantasy world. The game also contains segments that parody famous movies, such as <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=matrix"> The Matrix</a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=terminator"> Terminator</a>, and others.</p>
<p>The core of the gameplay is 3D platform action. Conker can jump, climb, swim, and attack enemies with various weapons (the default one being a frying pan). Conker can also collect money, which is sometimes needed to advance to a new area. The game world is reasonably open, containing an overworld from which the player can access large levels that take a while to explore. Talking to characters and performing tasks offered by them is one of the main devices used to advance the plot and unlock a different area.</p>
<p>A multiplayer mode is also included, allowing 4 players to battle it out in many different styles of multiplayer gameplay, including a deathmatch, a race, a "capture the flag"-like mini-game, etc.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>As one of the last "big" titles for the Nintendo 64, and one of Rare's last "Nintendo" titles, this game went places you never thought a Nintendo game could go.  To date, I've still never seen a game that crams in as much profanity, blood, gore, sexual innuendo, drunkenness, gross-out tactics in the first few levels alone, and what's truly shocking about all of it, it that it's actually FUNNY.  Unlike a lot of games that just cram in things for shock value, the things presented here actually have a purpose....  As far as things go in the game, anyway.</p>
<p>Graphically, the game is gorgeous, with lots of diverse areas, special effects, and great facial expressions for the characters, all of this without the use of the Expansion Pak.  As far as sound goes, the music goes from unbearingly happy, to some of the most impressive techno that's never spun off of a CD.  The voices are great, and the game never shuts up for a second.  Absolutely stunning for a cartridge game, and nothing ever came close to this title.  Every burp, fart, and zombie groan remain as clear as can be. </p>
<p>As for the humor, yes, it's definitely not for the easily offended, but in all the crude grossness, there are some truly clever movie parodies, and even just some of the casual conversations are just funny.  The game has a squirrel who is trapped in a world he drunkenly staggered into and doesn't understand, which in a way, seems like a bizarre version of "Alice in Wonderland".  Conker gets irritated with the situations around him.  He just wants money and to get home to his girlfriend....  While having a good time along the way, of course.  He's definitely an anti-hero with personality.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Since it's a Rare game, that means lots of fetch quests and item findings.  And sometimes, that just gets old.  However, the gameplay is so diverse, it keeps it from getting tedious too much too often.  And with it being a 3D title, the camera does a good job in keeping up, but sometimes, there are just some angles that get irritating, which leads to a lot of falling or too precise of walking over troubled areas. But really, the bads are so minor in comparison to the "goods" that this game offers. <br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>It's a shame that this came out so late, and Nintendo's perceived "kiddie" image turned some gamers away from the system and missing the title.  The game is hilarious, and the humor ranges from the crude and nasty to really clever puns and hilarious conversations.  The humor's a little more sophisticated in the game than one would expect.  This is NOT a title for the easily offended, because as classic and unforgettable as it is, not everyone's going to find the humor in battling a giant, opera-singing pile of poo.</p>
<p>The game deserved more recognition that it got, as even Nintendo had very little to do with this title.  But for one of the best all-time titles on the system, there may be room for Mario and Zelda, but a little drunken squirrel named Conker also pulled out of of the most impressive games around.  For the Nintendo 64 and for gaming in general.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Repetitive and childish humor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I genuinely don't want to play this.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Yes, I am doing the review in this style again. Partly because I have too little to work with and partly because I just got done moving an entire house full of laminate to the recycling-center. That aside though, "Conker's Bad Fur Day" is probably the game I have received the most requests for since I started reviewing games, but due to the price of the original cartridge (which tends to go for freaking 60 euros), I kept holding it back. Now that I have finally caved in, let's talk about the game and why I didn't like it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The game actually started off pretty well, Conker the Squirrel wakes up in the middle of nowhere and has to find a way back home. The problems however become very obvious, very soon. After talking with a character I had to jump across a few platforms to reach a bridge, it seemed like no big deal to me because I am used to platforming, but Conker controls unlike anything I have ever experienced before. To jump you have to hold Z and then press the A-button, but at the exact right height you need to press A again to activate his hover (you won't get anywhere without that hover). It took me more than an hour to get used to this and when I looked up a Let's Play of other people trying it, they seemed to have the same problem regardless of whether they had played it before or not.</p>
<p>Controls are a constant problem in Conker and there always seems to be something buggering me about them. In the very first level you need to scale a giant tower at one point, in the same fashion as the carnival level from Banjo &amp; Kazooie, but you always either let go, slip off or just miss the ladder altogether. Since Conker has no method of saving himself from falls (Kazooie's wing, Mario's ground-pound, Link's roll and etc.) this means you die instantly. Falls are also really weird, at one point I fell of a roof and took no damage, but after getting slightly higher on the roof and falling again I died instantly.</p>
<p>Okay, so the controls are terrible, but poor controls do not always mean that the gameplay itself is poor as well. Sadly, this time around it totally does. The first level of a game is supposed to draw players in and show off what they can expect later, therefore the first level is often not very difficult and involves little to no annoying mechanics. Mumbo's Mountain from Rare's true magnum opus comes to mind in this case. However, the farm-level that starts of Conker's Bad Fur Day is beyond tedious, the only thing you can do at the start is deal with a rat that is harassing some people. How do you do this? By walking halfway across the map to get some cheese for him, not spectacular, but not bad either. The problem? You have to do this roughly 3-4 times without dying in between!</p>
<p>That alone is simply retarded! Why would you start off your game with demanding that the player crosses the same obstacle course multiple times with no changes made to it? I was willing to forgive this by assuming that it was merely a way to open up the rest of the level and finally get the open-world effect that made other Rare games at the time so memorable, but once again this was not the case. What followed up after this aggravating fetch-quest was yet another one where I had to find 5-6 swarms of bees scattered across the map, this wouldn't be too bad, if they weren't placed at the most inconvenient points that make sure you die instantly when falling.</p>
<p>Writing all this down has made me realize that when people talk about this game, it is always about the humor (will get back to that later), but when you ask about controls and gameplay the conversation usually moves on. In some rare cases though, people praised the context-sensitivity buttons for been innovative tools that create variety in the gameplay. I can see where this is coming from, it's indeed clever that you can stand on a platform and press a button to get a new gameplay mechanic just for that moment. It makes sure that Rare didn't have to integrate a dozen or so actions in the standard control-scheme and indeed create any scenario they wanted without fear of restrictions. </p>
<p>What is my problem with them then? My problem is that they ruin any sense of thought, the second you walk into a new area and see that button, you have already figured out the puzzle. Let's just say you arrive in a room full of ghosts and see a context-sensitivity platform, the second you step on it and click the button you receive a flashlight. Would you, for even a second, doubt that the solution to navigating the room was using the flashlight on the ghosts? Now let's take the same scenario, but make the flashlight part of your basic equipment, along with several other tools and gadgets. The flashlight still seems like a logical solution, but if the other tools also relate to ghosts, you'd have to spend some time experimenting and maybe different ghosts react to different tools, meaning you'd have to switch and plan your moves.</p>
<p>Moving on to the humor... seriously guys? This is what caused hundreds of recommendations over the years? I don't mean to insult anybody, but this is a perfect case of liking something for the sole reason of it standing out, the same could be said about the insane praise given to Braid for been very artsy. Back on the Nintendo 64 violence and sex were very scarce and if they were in the game, they were very underplayed (no blood, no corpses and no openly stating that somebody was dead), so when a game like Conker comes out, everybody praises it for not doing this.</p>
<p>I would forgive this if Conker was genuinely clever, but frankly I must say that the humor will feel to most as repetitive and childish. Hearing a cartoon character swear or watching them get drunk may get a smile out of you once, but after a while it will lose all effect and become something that is just kind of there, to the point of it becoming awkward. Even more awkward is the constant vomiting and flatulence-jokes that show up everywhere all the time. Characters randomly release gas, there is an entire level early on dedicated to human and animal feces and even the intro shows characters vomiting. You'd have to be very young to get any enjoyment out of this.</p>
<p>While I would be willing to accept this all as merely the humor not been my thing, there is on flaw that genuinely affects the experience regardless of your age. This flaw is Conker's inconsistent behavior. Conker is at times downright psychotic, blatantly murdering anybody that he meets for no other reason than "because he can". Let's call this the Duke Nukem side of his behavior. I am sure some people would like this, but at various points in the plot Conker suddenly comes over as a genuinely sympathetic character. What kind of character does this leave you with? One moment he is using duct-tape to save the life of a wooden character he had met just an hour ago and a few moments later he is making jokes about the brutal murder on a baby dinosaur that accepted him as a mother he is about to commit. This behavior in turn results that Conker becomes a non-character, one that the player simply can't love due to the lack of any kind of characteristics. When Conker kills or at least witnesses the death of other main characters, all I could think of was how much rather I would have played as them.</p>
<p>So there you have it folks: a game that doesn't play well, isn't funny, requires no thought and is frankly obnoxious to sit through. I admit not always been immune to the powers of nostalgia, but to circle around a game whose only perk is that it stood out for been inappropriate for children at the time it was released is just downright silly. If they had worked more on making the game play more fluently and been less tedious, then perhaps Conker would fit right in with all the other high-quality puzzle/platformers from the 90's that people still love today, a status that while not as unique as it turned out, is at least a million times more admirable and rewarding.</p>

  </h2>
  <div id="trivia-text" class="text-break-word shrink-headings toggle-long-text">
    <h3>Development</h3>
<p><em>Conker's Bad Fur Day</em> was originally announced way back in 1997 as <em>Conker's Quest</em>. It was then changed to <em>Twelve Tales: Conker 64</em>. Then Rare decided it was too much like all other 3D platformers and decided to go with the whole mature feel with <em>Bad Fur Day</em>. Conker in his original cutesy form can be seen on the Game Boy game <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/15263/conkers-pocket-tales/">Conker's Pocket Tales</a>.</p>
<h3>References: movies</h3>

<li><em>Jaws</em>: Two parodies here. One parodying the girl being pulled around from the opening sequence and the chasing up the pier sequence.</li>
<li><em>Bram Stoker's Dracula</em>: The whole Dracula sequence. "Aah the children of the Night, vat sweet music they make".</li>

<li><em>Wizard of Oz</em>: When you flush The Great Mighty Poo, he says almost the same thing that the witch says when Dorothy dumps water on her., ''something something.. what a world, what a world''</li>
<li><em>Star Wars</em>: The name of the caveman Bunga the Knut (like Jabba the Hut)</li>
<li><em>Jurassic Park</em>: Raptor Eating the cave man just like in the movie</li>
<li><em>Lost in Space</em>: The chase seen where the spider mines chase him down the hall and one gets his leg cut off when the door closes.</li>

<li><em>Exorcist</em>: The little girl twisting her head</li>
<li><em>Dr. Strangelove</em>: The scientist character is almost exactly like the title character from that movie. In a wheelchair, slightly German accent, motorized mechanism on wheelchair that occasionally acts up...</li>
<li><em>Aliens</em>: The final battle is taken from the climax of the movie, complete with the hydraulic suit and the line, "Get away from her, you bitch!"</li>
