    <p>Billy "Commander Keen" Blaze, an eight-year-old genius, has flied to Mars in his Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket build out of common household objects. But while Keen was exploring Mars, the alien Vorticons stole vital parts from his ship and hid them in the Martian cities. Now Keen must find the stolen parts if he wants to return to Earth. </p>
<p><em>Commander Keen 1: Marooned on Mars</em> is the first in a series of platform games. Your objective is to find the 4 missing parts to your ship. </p>
<p>The game begins with a top-down map of Mars. This is the level select screen, where you can walk around and choose the next level you want to enter. On each level, you have to find the exit, and possibly grab a missing rocket part which may be on the level. Once you reach the exit, you're back on the map of Mars. </p>
<p>The levels are typically full of enemy creatures. Most numerous are Yorps, which are mostly harmless, if annoying, but other creatures are a genuine danger. If Keen gets shot or touched, or falls into a pit or some hazardous object, he dies, and you're booted out of the level back to the map of Mars and lose one of the lives. </p>
<p>Thankfully, Keen can defeat some of the enemies with his raygun. He can also find a pogo stick which allows him to jump very high. Other items to find include keycards that open locked doors and bonus items which give score (Keen gets an extra life if he collects enough score).</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>Before they came out with the popular first-person shooter, <i><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wolf3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a></i>, id Software made a trilogy of platform games that centers on eight-year-old Billy Blaze, an ordinary school kid who creates an interstellar spaceship, which he calls his “Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket”, using objects he finds around his house. He dons his brother’s helmet, and transforms into Commander Keen. The first episode, entitled ‘Marooned on Mars’, has Keen exploring the red planet to recover four vital components to his ship that the inhabitants stole while he is out exploring.</p>
<p>Therefore, the object of this <i>Commander Keen</i> episode is to recover all four parts scattered around Mars. When you begin the game, you are presented with a top-down view of the planet, in which you walk along a pre-defined path until you come across a building. Entering it gives you a side view where you need to get your hands on a raygun and get to the exit. Some areas of the building are locked behind colored doors, meaning you also need to collect keycards corresponding to that color. </p>
<p>There are two common lifeforms on the planet, and the first type you will encounter are the Yorps, friendly, one-eyed aliens that Keen eventually takes a liking to. They have the habit of getting in your way (especially in narrow gaps), even pushing you off the platform you are on. One way of dealing with them is by jumping on their heads to immobilize them for a few seconds. They make this cute sound as they go down. Then, you have the Gargs, who are much bigger than the Yorps. They walk around flashing their teeth. Like Yorps, they stop to survey their surroundings, and they charge at Keen when they spot him. Contact with a Garg results in a loss of life and a kick to the overhead view.</p>
<p>Once you have left that one building, a blue square with the word “Done” in huge letters take its place, and you can proceed on. Occasionally, there are shrines that you can enter. In these levels, you make your way to the top, avoiding hazards and enemies, and touching a Yorp statue which gives Keen a telepathic message. One of these hints is about the Standard Galactic Alphabet, the strange symbols you see throughout the game. An earlier shrine lets you retrieve a pogo stick, enabling Keen to get to places he is unable to reach by foot. The pogo is carried over to the rest of the series.</p>
<p>Also scattered around the buildings are various items that add to your score. The most common of these are lollypops, but you can also collect soda cans, pizza slices, textbooks, and teddy bears. Get enough of them, and you might earn an extra life. But if you happen to lose a life, you have to collect them again. </p>
<p>There is no background music while you are playing the game, but the sound effects are nice. You hear Keen's footsteps exactly as you should (both on the map and the normal levels.) The pistol sounds like a cartoon laser gun, and when Keen uses his pogo stick, it makes a nice boing. The sound of Keen dying is good, too. I love the way that Keen looks when he is hit, losing his whole torso, his legs still walking, and his mouth formed into an O-shape.</p>
<p>The controls are easy to use. Only one key can be pressed to make Keen jump, another to activate his pogo stick, and another to bring up the status panel which reveals your score, the number of lives, keycards that you have collected, and more. Before the game, I enjoyed reading the in-game story and watching the static previews of the next two episodes.
<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>When you are playing the normal levels, there is always that bland gray background that does not go well with me at all. It can get boring at times.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, you have to press a key to bring up the status panel which shows a lot of information. It would have been nice if that information would be displayed while you are playing the game, and to not have to press a key at all. </p>
<p>In order to fire your pistol, you have to press two keys: [Ctrl] and [Alt] at the same time. Since you are jumping or using your pogo stick most of the time, you may accidentally fire your pistol.</p>
<p>All these problems are rectified in the future Keen games.
<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Commander Keen is episode one of a great series. It may have the simple plot of retrieving stuff for your gizmo, but it is better than the games that involve you rescuing a damsel-in-distress. This game is ancient, but id did not throw in some timer problems, and that means that you will not have a problem running the game on modern systems. If you like platform games, especially the ones that involve you walking around a map and traveling to your next destination, then you won't go wrong with this one.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>The one good thing about Commander Keen (and its myriad sequels) was that it broke the mold for PC games- I feel it's somewhat responsible for the explosion of PC gaming.  It introduced console-style action games (and, more importantly, the scrolling platform game) to PC users.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Commander Keen, looked at in the context of late-80s platformer games, as opposed to compared to other PC games, is a very poor game.  The graphics are bland, the gameplay is boring... and it demonstrates how ill-suited the PC was for action games... a trend that continues to this day, with the PC dominating strategy games, and consoles dominating action games.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Commander Keen was a huge success, and was a very heavily hyped side-scrolling game in the vein of Super Mario Bros.  At the time of its release, it was considered the successor to Captain Comic and one could not avoid mention of the game in PD/SW software catalogues and BBSes.  It was designed for mid-to-high spec machines of the time, and was considered something of a wonder.</p>
<p>CK, in my opinion, plays like one of the many boring SMB clones that came out on the NES.  The game physics are tolerable, the gameplay is repetitive and somewhat on the slow side.  The graphics are average- poor in comparison to any game on any other platform of the time, but for the PC it was decent.</p>
<p>At the time of its release, I was a big Commodore 64/128 user- the Great Giana Sisters and Creatures were 2 hugely popular platformers from the same era, and I played them incessantly.  Perhaps the C64's colorful graphics and suitability for action games jaded my eye, because I couldn't believe how utterly lame CK was.  After all the hype, the $2000 PC was playing a game technologically inferior to a game played on a $99 C64, let alone the $99 NES and SMS, whose games were responsible for CK.</p>
<p>In the long run, of course, the PC platform has proven itself.  Games like CK are responsible- the games necessitated the upgrading and outfitting of PC systems in order to play them properly, lifting the PC market out of the CGA 4.77 mHz rut it'd been in since 1983.  Historically the game is important, and I keep a copy on my HD... but it isn't really on a par with any of the other platform games from the same era, and was very quickly superseded in quality and gameplay by other PC games.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>Commander Keen is arguably a legend by now, one of the first really stellar games published by Apogee and famed developers id. The concept is super-simple and fits perfectly for these games: Billy Blaze, eight years old genius, builds himself a functioning spaceship and after donning his brother's football helmet and calling himself "Commander Keen" the biggest badass in space, decides to explore the stars looking for adventure. His adventures would eventually take him on 7 sequels and around some of the weirdest planets in the universe, but seeing as how this was the first shareware release, Keen just decided to take a trip to Mars. What he finds there goes beyond that stupid face, and he encounters the evil Vorticons, which have stolen key parts off his spaceship. Mission? Get the parts back and leave Mars before mom finds out you are gone!</p>
<p>The gameplay of Keen is that of a standard platform game in which you jump around a lot grabbing items, avoiding enemies and clearing insanely twisting levels filled with all sorts of platforms, columns, blocks, etc... You also have a lot of key-card collecting and some levels require more thought that just "getting all the way to the right-side of the level" but that's as far as it goes. While this alone would have meant a "Dear god, not ANOTHER Mario Clone!" from almost anyone, two key factors saved it from that abyss: first the undeniable charm present in the game with it's wacky yet cuddly story, cute colorful graphics, and inventive levels. The other saving factor was that it was for the pc. Yes, FOR THE PC!!! Holy Shit! You mean PCs can handle smooth scrolling and all that jumping-shooting action and not explode?? Yup. Goodbye Nes, I won't miss you... well maybe a little but just until they find a way to emulate Metroid and Zelda...<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Well, while most of my memories are laced with the sweet smell of nostalgia, I still consider that there were very few flaws in the Keen series overall and practically none in this first release. The backgrounds needed some work for this first CK, and the mixing of the jump, pogo and fire controls was kinda awkward, but overall this is an absolutely solid game whose only other flaws are those defined by its genre.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Anyway, very entertaining levels, great graphics, silky-smooth scrolling and no peyote-eating plumbers in sight!! That spells golden for me!</p>
<p>Really, I can trace this game to many childhood memories of my past. Clearly being amongst the kickass games that definetively grounded me into PC-gaming first and foremost since it was one of those games that proved that consoles just weren't any magic boxes and anything they did the pc could do better. :)) Ya!...but even if I am one rambling idiot and consoles are king of the hill, the fact remains that CK is a very very good platformer game.</p>

    <h3>Development</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Tom+Hall">Tom Hall</a> (via <a href="http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&amp;id=256" rel="nofollow">Classic Gaming</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first game was actually a joke. It was called Dangerous Dave in 'Copyright Infringement.' (John) Carmack had just gotten a little guy to move around over a tile map, and I looked over at the Nintendo in the corner. I said, 'Wouldn't it be funny to make the first level of Super Mario 3...tonight?' Carmack smiled and said, 'Let's do it!' I copied the tiles pixel for pixel and made a map out of them while Carmack feverishly programmed the guy landing on ground tiles and getting coin tiles. At 5:30 in the morning, we dumped that on (John) Romero's desk and went home to crash. Romero played it all the next day, saying 'This could make so much money!' It was pitched to a friend of a friend at Nintendo, and they liked it so much, they wanted a demo. We added Mario graphics and Koopas and stuff, and sent it to them. It apparently got to the head guys at Nintendo, but they didn't want to enter the PC market.</p>
<p>Softdisk didn't want to use the smooth scrolling trick Carmack had discovered (since it didn't also work in CGA!), so we thought, well, if they don't want it, we could do something ourselves.... So we thought, hey, we'll make our own game. We needed a topic. I asked if they cared what topic-sci-fi, fantasy, whatever. I think Carmack mentioned a kid that saves the galaxy or something. I went off and fifteen minutes later, came back with the paragraph that you see in Keen 1. I read it in a Walter Winchell voice (he's a nasal 40s radio/newsreel announcer). Carmack clapped after I was finished, and we were off and running.</p>
<p>We got contacted by Scott Miller of Apogee, and once Keen was published, it was making enough for us to live on, so we quit and formed id.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Mods</h3>
<p>There are some level packs and even mods (files changing the graphics in the games) circulating for this game. </p>
<h3>References</h3>
<p>Throughout the game there are references to Keen's grandfather, whose name is William J. Blazkowicz. Interestingly, William J. Blazkowicz is the main character in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Wolfenstein+3D:+Third+Encounter">Wolfenstein 3D</a>, id's first person shooter made two years later.</p>
<h3>Signs</h3>
<p>The writings on the signs in the game actually make sense. Much like the runic writing in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Ultima">Ultima</a>, you can translate it letter by letter and discover what they mean. There is a table to help you translate all those messages on 3drealm's website.</p>
<h3>Trilogy</h3>
<p><em>Marooned on Mars</em> is the first of three episodes of the series <em>Commander Keen: Invasion of the Vorticons</em>.</p>
