    <p><em>Fable: The Lost Chapters</em> is a version of Lionhead's Xbox-exclusive <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/14876/fable/">Fable</a>, featuring enhancements to storyline and gameplay.</p>
<p>The game expands the main plot of the original release, continuing it beyond the final confrontation as well as adding nine new areas and sixteen quests. A few characters from the earlier version participate in the storyline more actively and have their own quests. Additional content includes new buildings, monsters, weapons, spells, items, and armor. The protagonist also has more expressions and ways of communicating with people at his disposal. In the computer versions players have the ability to create their own tattoo designs and import them into the game.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>The first thing a person should know about Fable: The Lost Chapters (referred to from here on as Fable)  is that, as far as action-RPG hybrids go, it's much more 'action' than 'RPG'. This characterisation plays out in all aspects of the game, from its lovely presentation and score by Danny Elfman to its unsophisticated role-playing elements.</p>
<p>The AI is respectable throughout the game. Some of the fights get pretty difficult, although most enemies only have one or two different attacks. This is probably the single exception to the rule of simplicity detailed below. </p>
<p>The presentation value of this excellent. The graphics are good if not splendid, and have a lovely 'cartoony' feel that is fantasy-like without being childish. The added soft bloom effect also adds a dream-like quality of the visuals that works well (unlike in say, Deus Ex 2). More importantly, you could easily run this game at 1280x1024 on a mid-range computer (I have a 6600 GT and an athlon 64 2800) with every option cranked up (except shadow detail, which is a framerate killer as always).  The colours of the visuals are rich and varied, the special effects are spectacular and fast-paced. The character models as well as monster models and NPC's are unique and suit the 'Fable' title very well. Indeed, the models used for the entire world function to make the game seem like a fantasy story, which is a real coup because it would have been so easy to go wrong in this attempt.</p>
<p>The sound effects and score are impeccable. <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/58989/danny-elfman/">Danny Elfman</a> has written a beautiful, fantasy-laden score. Again, this score serves to make the game more 'fable-like' and could have so easily gone wrong that it is a testament to Elfman's and the developer's abilities that it all works so well. The monsters make noises that suit them, the 'action' music differs enough from the string-heavy 'ambient' music to make it clear, the 'magic' sound effects are fabulous across the board.</p>
<p>The controls are tight, true, and fantastically done. Again, the production value of this game shines through. Obviously a great deal of attention was lavished on making the controls seamless. The hack-n-slash or magic combat is intuitive but also difficult to master. The camera is never awkward and there are sufficient opportunities for camera angle customisation as well. There are tutorials in the beginning and as you encounter new facets of the game, so you never feel unsure as to what to do.</p>
<p>The voice acting is excellent as well. The designers clearly went to the effort of hiring ACTUAL British actors rather than just getting Americans, Kiwis, or Australians to do cheesy accents. There are enough different accents and voices that you don't feel that you're just cycling through the same five voice actors. None of the dialogue feels called-in (compare to Star Trek games with Patrick Stewart's voice), rather, it all seems imminent and believable. </p>
<p>The plot is decent if entirely predictable. Yes, there is a magic sword. The entire point of an epic Fable IS to be predictable, so this is excusable. Unfortunately, the plot is very short. If you wanted to, you could probably work through the main quest in less than 10 hours.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of different things to do in this game as well. From marrying to finding lost treasure to looking for silver keys to open the locked chests throughout to opening the ten or so 'demon doors' to get secret items, there are definitely too many things to do in one go through the game. Unfortunately, this doesn't translate into 'replay value' for this game, as I'll explain below.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>These strengths noted, there are numerous flaws that keep this game out of the 'great' category. They generally fall into the broad statement: this game is aimed at unsophisticated gamers.</p>
<p>Firstly, and most importantly, the role-playing elements of this game are superficial and limited. Even more so than <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Knights+of+the+Old+Republic">Knights of the Old Republic</a> 1 or 2 (see my reviews if you so desire), this game feels like D&amp;D for kids. There are two major pseudo role-playing elements to this game: your appearance and your skills/fighting type. You can use tattoos and haircuts to adjust the way you look and you can select from abilities within three broad skill types: strength, skill, and will. This ultimately works out to you getting to select fighter, thief, or mage skills. On paper, this is fine, but it doesn't work out well and suggests that they might have aimed the game at people new to or unrelated to RPGs, but if that's the case, why bother at all?</p>
<p>This is because your appearance has no gameplay impact, save making people fall in love with you (which also has no gameplay impact). So there just isn't any reason to bother. They've incorporated and 'age' system whereby the longer you play, the older you get. Again, this works OK on paper but it ends up being more annoying than fun. By the end of the game, you look much, much older than your mother! And who wants to beat the ultimate bad guy as an old grandfather? I found the age function less than satisfying. Moreover, the tattoos and haircuts don't actually change the character model (again, compare to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Knights+of+the+Old+Republic">KOTOR</a> 1 or 2 or <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Neverwinter+Nights">Neverwinter Nights</a>). This function is window-dressing...a fun presentation element that's well incorporated but ultimately puerile</p>
<p>The 3-skill type system turns out to be too simplistic. Note that it's not a level-based experience system. You earn experience points from killing things and from using a given type of skill (e.g., you get strength experience and 'general' experience you can use on learning any skill) which you can spend to learn more advanced skills. The trouble is that there are only 30 skills and 24 of them are magic-based. If you play a fighter or a thief, you'll run out of things to learn quickly and you'll be left exploring mage skills by default. Again, it's just too simplistic. Moreover, the game is ridiculously easy as a fighter or as a fighter/mage, which is ultimately what you'll be forced to play. </p>
<p>There are only four or so 'levels' of armor or weapons in the game. This gets especially annoying as you get the best armor in the game after just a couple of hours of play-time. Simplistic design again.</p>
<p>This is unrelated to simplicity but is another gripe: who is this game aimed at? The graphics and simplistic game play suggest that it's aimed at younger teenagers or people new to RPGs. But if that's the case, why the adult themes throughout the game? You can shag your wife (complete with dubious sound effects) and in within the first 20 minutes of the game you see a picture of your kid sister with blood streaming out of her eyes after having them stabbed out by 'bandits'. <br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>In the end, Fable is a good but not a great game. It's a great action game that's well-presented in all aspects. Seamless gameplay, nice graphics, fantasy-like setting, and fun character models. Unfortunately, it suffers greatly for simplicity in plot, RPG elements, and some action elements. This simplicity will annoy seasoned RPG gamers and potentially confuse action-oriented gamers. It also makes one wonder who this game is designed for.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>The best part about this game was sadly the presentation. If you can stand the art direction (oversized gloves and charicatures), you'll enjoy the graphical quality of the game. Also, the sound is very pleasant. If the game had been more balanced, the character creation would have been a blast to play with too.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Fable is a completely linear game that plays out the same way every time you play it. No matter what you accomplish in the game, it will still stay the same. No matter how you choose to create your character, the main story will stay exactly the same. The only thing you are able to affect are the amount of challenges (a really dumb idea) and sidequests you want to participate in.</p>
<p>Character creation starts out good, as it seemingly lets you create exactly the character you play, ie. you get experience points for the skills you use. Unfortunately, the game is extremely badly balanced, and once you get a specific 'skill' (won't mention it here as I feel it is a spoiler) you will never find any difficulty again.</p>
<p>The last thing I didn't like about this game are the confined maps. The maps are all very small, corridor-like and uninspired. This is hardly noticeable at first, because the graphics dazzles you, but after a while you'll notice that you practically never get lost. "Just follow the corridor in the forest, young padawan!".<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Fable isn't really a true RPG. There are no dialogue options for starters, instead you communicate with body language. The exploration parts are there, but they are extremely weak as you're bound to go basically everywhere eventually anyhow because you have to (main quest). It plays out more like an action adventure (all combat is real time, twitch based) with RPG elements than anything I would refer to as a RPG.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br><b>Review Version</b>: v2.0 Major update after re-playing da game.<br>
<b>Review Date</b>: January 29, 2008<br>
<b>Review Length:</b> 9 page(s).<br>
<b>Game Version</b>: v1.0 (I think) and later v25.7.13.149<br>
<b>Tech Specs Used:</b> Intel Dual Core 2 1.86 Ghz Processor, 1GB Memory, 256MB NVIDIA 7300 LE Video Card.<br>
<b>Alignment Used</b>: Tried both good and evil. Preferred having horns than butterflies though.<br>
<b>Finished</b>: Yes, twice.<br>
<b>Last time played:</b> January, 2009.</p>
<p>If there was one game that I'd call a life saver for me in all those dang years where PC games looked like they were going to die, then this is it. Back then it has been a very, very good while since I've played a darn good RPG game, if not a darn good PC game that gave me a good feel. This is one of those games.</p>
<p>To this point, I’ve played the game twice with at least 2-3 years in between. So, the second time around I’m a bit more objective. It also seems that this later version I’m playing has been upgraded a bit too much. One thing I noticed is that I can’t seem to kill children anymore, but I’ll get to that later for all you people currently in aghast. :p</p>
<p><b>Introduction: About the Game – For Readers who never played the game</b>:<br>
The game is 3rd Person RPG game with various elements of what people may identify as “adventure” in today’s terms. Bear in mind, this isn't a “heavy duty” PC RPG game. It isn't even an RPG game in the traditional sense. It's more of a console RPG game (or what some people may call Japanese RPGs/JRPGs) adapted to the PC platform. This is a very light RPG game, where you really can't take it seriously since the uses an extremely simple humor-related type story. So if you’re looking for combat mechanics, this is the game for you. If you’re looking for a story, go play an adventure game and leave us RPG traditionalists alone. :p </p><ul>
<b>Quests</b><br>
The main purpose of the game is to complete quests given out to you by the Heroes Guild. Some of these quests are optional; main quests are obviously mandatory. Sub-quests are identified by a silver color; main quests are identified by a gold color (and some optional-bronze color). Many quests have an additional feature where the hero may “boast” at the boasting platform. Boasts allow the hero to bet and win money if he successfully carries out a specific boast in relation to the quests. Example boasts are “finishing the quest naked” (obvious, additionally cannot use certain magic spells), “fist fighter” (cannot use weapons or offensive magic), etc. These boasts are of course optional to the player, however adding more boasts does allow the player to win more money (and fame) additionally, it allows a change in gameplay for each different boast. Killing an enemy without weapons (fist fighter) does take a very, very long while.<p></p>
<p><b>Character Overview</b><br>
Initially, you play a male child with a seemly oversized head and hands. At this point, the graphical differences from modern 3D RPGs and traditional 2D RPGs become quite apparent. This part of the game is the “intro section” where you get used to the controls of the game. Actual gameplay occurs much, much later when you graduate from the Heroes Guild. Unfortunately, this section of the game cannot be skipped, which I have tried many times. The main character then becomes a male adult who now plays the role of a “hero”, fresh out of the heroes’ guild.</p>
<p>Everything about the character may be seen from the character sheet, accessible by pressing the default button ‘Esc’. Here, you may see the progress of the hero. Including alignments, quest progress, martial status, sexuality, monster kills, etc. </p>
<p><b>Combat</b><br>
Our new hero is capable of various techniques. In combat, the hero may various combinations of 3 different combat styles: Melee, Ranged, and Magic. Melee consists of an up-close and personal approach with melee weapons or fist-fighting. </p>
<ul><b>Melee weapons</b> are divided into light and heavy weapons. Light weapons deal less damage but are faster (e.g. swords). Heavy weapons deal more damage but are slightly slower (e.g. maces). In melee combat, the hero may attack, block, and even maneuver by rolling in a certain direction. Normal attacks may be blocked from any direction (automatic when blocking). However, the hero may only block similar melee attacks. Ranged and magical attacks cannot be blocked, and may only be dodged (by rolling out of the way).

Additionally, there is a power attack which is indicated by a purple/blue glow from the melee weapon. A power attack cannot be normally blocked, and thus will always deal damage. However, if the hero is damaged, the power attack glow will disappear until it shows up again. Power attacks emerge after a series of blocked attacks by your hero or a series of successful attacks.

<b>Ranged weapons</b> consist of longbows and crossbow. Longbows load faster but deal less damage than crossbows. Crossbows deal more damage but take considerably longer to load ammunition. Aiming with ranged weapons is automatic and will always as long as an enemy is targeted. There is also a 1st person snipe mode to target enemies from a longer distance. Human targets may be decapitated if the hero aims for the head (not quite sure how an arrow can do that, but there you go). Arrows and crossbow bolts are considered unlimited in the game and do not need to be bought.

<b>Magic</b> consists of various different types:<ul>
<b>Assault spells</b> are battle spells magic that deals direct damage to an enemy. [Note: Instant spells may be cast instantly. Power-up spells require some time before it can be cast] Spells under this category are:<ul> 
<li><b>Battle Charge</b>: [Instant Spell] Propels the caster in a direct forward line knocking down any enemy in its path, more likely due to the sense of smell as the hero never seems to bathe. Higher levels will allow longer line and more damage.
</li><li><b>Enflame</b>: [Instant Spell] Blasts the area surrounding the caster. Enemies will be knocked down. Extremely useful for cooking if fine ones self in the midst of multiple domesticated chickens. Higher levels of enflame will cover a larger area and more damage.
</li><li><b>Fireball</b>: [Power-up Spell] The classic long range spell allows the mage to throw a fireball at a distant enemy. Higher levels will allow explosions, causing area damage to the enemy, knocking down all in its vicinity and more damage. Fireballs maybe cast on different levels if the hero chooses to.
</li><li><b>Lightning</b>: [Instant Spell] Electricity leaps from the caster and damages several enemies at once. Higher levels allow more enemies to be targeted simultaneously with more damage. The lightning spell has an automatic target system, which means that you only need to target one enemy and it will always hit. Enemies near the targeted enemy will also be damaged (basic spell hits 3 targets, higher levels will target more enemies). Additionally, all enemies currently being damaged by the spell are semi-paralyzed, only allowing a few steps of movement.
</li><li><b>Multi Strike</b>: [Instant Spell] A melee support spell. Allows the blade of the caster hit the enemy multiple times. The attack cannot be blocked. Higher levels allow more strikes (minimum three, maximum five…er I think) and more damage.
</li><li><b>Divine Fury</b>: [Power-up Spell] Calls the power of the Good Gods to strike down enemies from the heavens. This area attack spell requires a bit of time to cast, during which the caster is immobile and subject to damage from adjacent enemies. When the spell is cast, enemies in a pre-designated circle surrounding the caster, as well as enemies the circle, will be paralyzed and subject to continuous damage.
</li><li><b>Infernal Wrath</b>: [Power-up Spell] The evil version of Divine Fury. There is no difference between Divine Fury and Infernal Wrath except in graphical presentation and purchase/upgrade requirements.</li></ul>
<b>Surround spells</b> allow the caster to manipulate the reality surrounding him. All spells under this category are cast instantly, but usually have a time limit effect. Spells under this category are:<ul> 
<li><b>Force Push</b>: The infamous Jedi spell that knocks down and damages all enemies surrounding the Jedi…er…hero. The damage is minimal but the spell is instant and requires only a bit of mana. Higher levels allow more (minimal) damage and an increased surrounding range of “pushing”.
</li><li><b>Slow Time</b>: The opposite version of moving fast, is making everyone else slow. Enemies will be cast in slow motion, while you will move in normal speed. The graphical display also changes, showing a clock-like feature on the screen. Probably ineffective during actual gameplay.
</li><li><b>Turn Coat</b>: Temporarily turns enemies into allies, if cast by the caster from close range. Somewhat problematic as there is minimal graphical display that the spell is being cast or if the enemy can actually be “turned”. Not all enemies are affected by this spell. Higher levels will allow enemies to be affected longer. And no, you can’t use this on girls…I’ve tried. :p
</li><li><b>Drain Life</b>: A favorite of evil Will Users (read=evil mage), drains enemies of their life source and transfers it to the caster. These “transfers’ are seen as glowing balls of light which fill follow the caster and replenish his life. Higher levels will allow more “balls of light” to be harnessed from the enemy. Using this spell will affect the casters’ alignment slightly towards evil.
</li><li><b>Summon</b>: A soul is summoned from the netherworld to aid the caster. Initial soul comes in form of a wasp. If the wasp kills an enemy stronger than its current self, it will change to the soul of that enemy. These “upgrades” are permanent, so the next time the hero casts the spell, it will summon last strongest version the last soul killed. A bit tricky trying to “help” the soul kill a stronger version of its-self. Not all enemies are subject to the soul-transfer, though.</li></ul>
<b>Physical spells</b> are apparently spells that don’t seem to have an in-game explanation on what the hell physical spells are :p Spells under this category are:<ul>
<li><b>Assassins’ Rush</b>: Probably the most useful spell in the game. Allows the caster to be promptly “teleported” to the target enemy, preferably behind the target. Thus usually allows a free attack at the target. Mana cost is minimal, thus may be used several times per enemy without constantly checking your mana reserves. Higher levels allow a longer distance of teleportation to a distant enemy. Also, while “teleporting” the caster is immune from all damage.
</li><li><b>Berserk</b>: A melee support spell, which transfers the caster into a red version of the Incredible Hulk. All attacks cannot be blocked, and the casters clothes are considered to be extremely elastic (even the Plate Armor) as they don’t seem to shred to pieces. Personally, I’m more interested in the heroes’ tailor than the spell. :) 
</li><li><b>Heal Life</b>: Heals the life of the caster as well as all non-hostiles in his direct vicinity. Extremely useful if the hero wishes to heal NPCs (Non-Player Characters).
</li><li><b>Physical Shield</b>: Allows the caster to be immune to ALL damage effect while using this spell. Damage however is subtracted from the casters’ mana reserves until the mana runs out and the spell aborts. Constantly using mana potions will avert this affect. This spell in mandatory if the hero wishes to use the “Take no damage” boast during quests, or good luck trying to dodge that Rock Troll. :p
</li><li><b>Ghost Sword</b>: Summons a spirit sword from one the inventory of one angry dead blacksmith :p The sword will continue to attack enemies of the caster until the time is run out or the sword is destroyed. Higher levels will allow up to 4 swords to be cast.
</li><li><b>Multi Arrow</b>: The only ranged support spell in the game. Allows multiple arrows or bolts to strike the enemy when the caster is using a ranged weapon. These “arrows” are seen as balls of light encircling the caster. They will remain there permanently until the caster actually uses them. Higher levels will allow more “balls of light” and thus more arrows to strike the enemy.</li></ul></ul></ul>
<p><b>Character Alignment</b><br>
The game introduces a “good and bad” system which affects the physical features of the character as well as the response of others to the hero. However, the alignment really does not affect game play, i.e. it does not additional quests to be opened or limit quests the hero may access. This is more of an atmospheric feature. The more inclined the hero is to either good or evil, will also unlock more alignment-type expressions. Expressions are communication features the hero may use when interacting with people, such as apologize for good heroes or vulgar thrust for evil heroes. In either case, expressions actually have no particular use during gameplay.</p>
<p>A good aligned hero will be more welcome when meeting people in the game. Killing monsters is regarded as example good acts. These people may be asked to “follow” the hero if the hero wishes to. Though the intentions are usually more “evil” then they are good (followers are good distractions for hungry Balverines). An extremely good hero will notice that his physical features will change: butterflies will start to surround him, an aura of light, his eyes begin to glow, etc.</p>
<p>An evil aligned hero will be feared when meeting people in the game…especially by children. Killing people, stealing, assaulting innocents are considered example evil acts. An extremely evil hero will notice that his physical features will change: horns start grow from his forehead, flies will start to surround him, a red aura of light, his eyes begin to glow, etc.</p></ul>
<b>Graphics</b><br>
The best way for me to describe the graphics is “cheerful. ”No-nonsense anime-like console graphics which should've looked ugly on the PC but it didn't. The colors are very bright and "pretty", probably because I've been playing too many games with dark colors. The graphics of the game also remind the player that they are indeed “playing a game”. Graphically it disregards the “immersion factor of reality” but more focuses on the “immersion factor of a game”. Personally, I believe gamers really need to be constantly reminded that they are indeed playing a game, instead of a re-creation of reality.<p></p>
<p>I like the way they pictured the character and the clothing. Big head, big hands, looks somewhat dorky the first time around but looks way cool after you start wearing some decent clothes. The accessories of clothing in this game are oddly addictive to my opinion. Clothes have complete “sets”. For example, if you find a plate helmet, there is sure to be plate gloves and boots somewhere, thus a complete set. You can even wear dresses if you find them. A combination of different clothes makes the hero look physically unique. Combining plate armor on the torso and using a dark dress is quite fascinating, though it may encourage certain physiological tendencies I’d rather not get into right now. :)</p>
<p>I was more interested in clothing in this game then I was when I was playing <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=the+Sims">the Sims</a>. Not to mention trying out different types of hairstyles and tattoos.</p>
<p><b>Story-Related &amp; Voice Acting</b><br>
Very light and very mediocre for hard-core RPG gamers, even to the point where it is somewhat insulting to the average adventure genre-lover. The story “tries” to be tragic and ironic, it may well be so felt by younger audiences which I believe is the primary target audience. The mature (over-30) audience will be 100% be not so impressed…unless of course they don’t go out very often. :p</p>
<p>However, regardless of the overall lack of story, to a certain point some stories portrayed in the sub-quests do a bit of justice, although honestly there severely aren’t enough of them. One sub-quest I would like to point out is the “Book Finding” sub-quest. Here a school teacher requests the hero find books so he can teach them to the children. It is personally a joy, seeing the teacher read the stories, seeing the children’s responses and in some instances, the book is used for a play/drama by the children. Most of them are humorous, some dry, but acceptable regardless. The children by the way in this game, are an absolute delight (well, ignore the fact that I try to kill them once in a while :p). All of them are cute and cuddly and their basic movements are curiously quite similar to most children (including myself) in that age.</p>
<p>In this regard, I would like to commend ALL the voice acting in this game. As far as voice-acting goes in games, its Oscar-nomination worthy…especially the children.</p>
<p><b>Game Mechanics</b><br>
My, my. For me the one of the most important elements in RPG IS combat. Though I am an RPG veteran player, and while you and I know that every RPG player on earth would say that the most important element in an RPG is either the story/plot or the character customization process, in practice I believe this is not so. It’s the combat mechanics that made RPG games last this long. </p>
<p>Anyway, the combat mechanics of this game to me was almost perfect. Even more so when you want to maneuver quickly. Considering I didn't think this was an action game to begin with, this game has better mechanics than most adventure/action games I've played. You roll when you want to roll, you strike when you want to strike, you cast spells when you want to, etc.</p>
<p>Since in most action games where timing is essential, this game did not fail me in this area. However, either it’s my imagination again, in the later version of the game, I noticed slight alternations in game mechanics. There seems to be a certain delay in some movements. Most irritating is that you cannot certain actions whilst casting spells or blocking (er…I think). Also, I think it’s my current mouse, but the default ‘block’ button, i.e. middle mouse button, was quite difficult to use. Had to change it to ‘ctrl’, though later in the game I didn’t use it much. Finally, there aren’t enough quick slots to choose from.</p>
<p><b>Music</b><br>
Either it has background "noise" or it actually has music. Music in a game is something that you "notice". If you don't notice it, then it's not worth the mention, now is it? Music in <i>Fable</i> IS noticaeble. One thing that needs to be underlined is that whoever created the compositions for this game, understands the meaning of "epic" when it comes to music. Which is far from what I can say for <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bethesda">Bethesda</a> and their "epic-type-games-without-epic-type-music" <em>sigh</em>. </p>
<p>The music greatly adds and supports the immersion factor in this game. From the compositions I can recall, three come to mind:<br>
[1] Basic traveling;<br>
[2] Combat music;<br>
[3] Horror background. This one actually something I'd expect from a good horror movie, not from a game.<br>
Overall, the music is extremely top-notch in the world of gaming musical compositions. </p>
<p><b>Sub Quests, Non-Quests, Fishing in the Pond</b><br>
<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> must be one of the inspirations of this game. You know what makes a Final Fantasy game? Not the story. Its all those little mini games that divert you from actually finish the game. Fable does this also, though not very successfully but at least a worthwhile effort.</p>
<p>A demon in full body armor fishing by a pond? This is the first game in existence where such a feature could actually occur. So there I am, my character, taking the evil path. Filled with nasty horrifying tattoos, red-blackish body armor, and horns that would envy any Spanish matador...</p>
<p>...and what is he doing?<br>Fishing by a pond in the middle of the forest.<br>Enjoying himself.<br>More than often, this game really is a vacation...</p>
<p><b>Philosophical Mindset</b><br>
For the enlightened and most beginner philosophers, at a very light level this game is actually very deep. It identifies the perfect impossible utopia world for high level philosophers: A place where both good and evil co-exists. Not that good and evil every actually existed in the first place (whether you believe it or not), as everything is merely action and re-action. People then identify some actions and re-actions as good, others as evil, and later they are re-affirmed as fundamental ‘truths’. Both are a part of our lives, as we all makes those choices, some prefer to go left, some people prefer to go right. Some people believe that left is right and right is left. :p It's just a matter of choice and interpretation of things.</p>
<p>Later there is a background story regarding this. Apparently once upon a time, the Guild only had “good quests” but a rebellion occurred, including Maze and the Guildmaster which late allowed evil quests to be allowed. In the end, the acolytes themselves had the discretion of what path they want to choose, not the guild.</p>
<p><b>Voice-overs and the lighter side of things</b><br>
Well, our hero doesn't say much. Actually he usually doesn't say anything at all. It’s one of those games where you don't say anything, but everyone else does (which is much better than RPGs where the hero says “…” half of the time). This is actually something I prefer compared to a lot of adventure games with useless dialog that doesn't affect the gameplay nor doesn't add much depth either. </p>
<p>The game is set in a dark ironic setting or more than often a light humorous side of things. If you start kicking a lot of chickens around, people start calling you chicken chaser. It’s somewhat irritating in the beginning. but it comes to the point where it actually gets funny. A lot of stupid and funny events occur throughout the course in the game during the weird dialogs. The hero tends to reply with a "Doh" facial feature on his face in most cases. Priceless. However, on the bad side of things, it does get a tad tough to personalize yourself with the hero, due to the lack of “depth” in it all.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>From the storyline alone, people who have finished the game will say 2 things usually. </p>
<p><b>[1] Too Darn Short</b><br>
To a certain extent is almost blasphemy for the average RPG game. The game tends to get a bit longer if you don't follow the main plot and start side-tracking by killing monsters or finishing side quests. It gets a tad longer if you choose the evil path and kill residents so you can buy their houses. Unfortunately, there really aren’t that many side-quests and other stuff to entertain you in comparison to Final Fantasy games.</p>
<p>I was pretty much upset that the "quests" from the guild were not random. It there were random quests, this game world really be more enjoyable and if not longer. I detected that the developers may wanted to do more quests, but the idea was scratched. This is indicated by the first quest you receive, there were 3 other quests mentioned but not available since the hero did not enough fame. I went as far as to kill as many monsters as possible to reach the fame requirement, but those quests were suddenly “removed” from the Guild.</p>
<p>The game can be very much distracting in a good way in the first parts of the story. You have many places to explore, side quests, fishing, but that get old fast. The game gets pretty direct when get to Knothole Glade (or after the Prison break-scene). The side quests become fewer in number, and the other distractions usually available in the beginning parts of the game also become noticeably non-existent. Next thing you know, it becomes one main-quest after another, next thing you know, you’ve almost finished the game.</p>
<p>If you follow the main plot, it really is very much short. Way too darn short.</p>
<p><b>[2] Too Darn Shallow</b><br>
This game could have been much more. Really, this game could've been really, really much more. This game had a lot of potential and could've been one of those bright starts in the hall of RPG legends...</p>
<p>Personally I recommend this game to any RPG gamer or anyone who likes weird light humor. But prepare to be somewhat irritated when you finish the game.</p>
<p><b>[3] Additional Irritation from later versions.</b> Reserved for the philosophically mature audience.<br>
I re-played the game and found many things have changed. Not quite sure if it’s my imagination or maybe I’m just getting old. However, one thing I did notice is that now you can’t kill children. </p>
<p>Well, it’s politically incorrect to kill children, any idiot understands that. But it’s also morally incorrect to kill any human life form (or life in general depending on your belief system), why limit killings only to children? Because any idiot understands that, thus society educates us to become knowledgeable only at an idiot level. Look, people (especially parents) really should start to understand that you cannot protect everyone from reality. You can teach them the difference between good and evil and the variations in between. Hiding evil from people only makes the susceptible to harsher versions of evil, as I once became personally subject with. People really need to be responsible enough to know the difference that “this is a game”. A GAME. </p>
<p>If it is the politically correct idea to teach youngsters to the point where they cannot tell the difference between what is good and what is bad from a game, then personally one should start wondering the intelligence factor of the parent or society in question.<br>Teach children to be responsible for their own actions.<br> Teach parents to be responsible for their own teachings.<br>Teach gamers its O.K. to kill children in games, but they’ll be swiftly crucified if they even remotely try to think or experiment in reality.<br>Teach intelligence, not politically correct stupidity.<br>
We were given a brain. I suggest we use it.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Personally I recommend this game to any RPG gamer or anyone who likes weird light humor. But prepare to be somewhat irritated when you finish the game.</p>
<p><b>End Note</b>. If you didn’t notice it before, the title “Fable” is incorrect. Fables are stories about animals (e.g. Aesop’s Fables), last time I checked.<br>
<b>End Review</b>. Game of the year in my book. Recommended more for gamers that prefer combat mechanics over story. Story oriented gamers are cautioned in advance about this game.</p>

  <h2>Trivia
    
  </h2>
  <div id="trivia-text" class="text-break-word shrink-headings toggle-long-text">
    <h3>References</h3>
<p>In the Lychfield graveyard, there is a tombstone that reads: "Yaggath Sonnog-Sleeper in the Dark, wake and rise." This is a reference to H.P. Lovecraft's Great Old Ones of the Cthulhu mythos. Yog-Sothoth, is the most powerful and most mysterious of the elder gods. This is little surprise as Lionhead is based in the UK. Where Lovecraft has a huge following. </p>
<h3>Title translation</h3>
<p>A verbatim translation of the Chinese title is:</p>
<p>shen = god  </p>
<p>gui = devil  </p>
<p>yuyan = fable  </p>
<p>shiluo de = lost  </p>
<p>zhang = chapter  </p>
<p>jie = segment</p>
<p>It's interesting to note that the title broaches the game's main issue, it being a "Fable of a God or a Demon" according to players' decisions.</p>
