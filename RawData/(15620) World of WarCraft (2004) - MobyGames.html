    <p><em>World of Warcraft</em> is a MMORPG based in the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Warcraft">Warcraft</a> universe. The player creates a character choosing from 8 races and 9 classes. Most races start in their own part of the vast world. As the races move out from their starting locations, they can meet the other races if they choose to move out through the world. Both races and classes have unique abilities, skills, and spells to help them survive in the world.</p>
<p>The game offers professions for players to learn, if they want. You have the choice of 2 major professions, such as Alchemy, Herbalism, Skinning, and Tailoring, as well as the ability to have unlimited minor professions, such as Fishing and Cooking. Progressing in these skills allows you to make more things or have better results from the skills.</p>
<p>The gameplay is similar to most other MMORPG games, where you must go out into the world, complete quests, kill monsters, and level up your character. And, as often is the case, you also will want to find, make, or buy better equipment as you go along. There are multiple levels of equipment from normal to artifact based on rarity. The player can also join various guilds and parties.</p>
<p>You also can move quickly between areas by learning to ride a mount when your level is high enough, or taking another form of transport that you can't control movement for, such as train, griffon, and more.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>In my opinion, World or Warcraft (more simply abbreviated WoW for the rest of this review) does not do anything so amazingly revolutionary or new from the rest of its counterparts in the MMORPG genre.  It doesn’t do anything totally or completely unexpected from many other MMO’s out there.  Most elements can be seen borrowed from other RPG franchises, and as a whole one could possibly label it “generic”.  But what WoW so brilliantly does is that it takes what its other brethren have created and made it easier and more fun to play.  It has taken its content and made it a perfect form as to create a perfect gaming environment that is both easy and fun to play in, is not vague or confusing, and is addictive as Hell.  And that, my friends, makes all the difference.</p>
<p>WoW has a lot of elements borrowed from every other genre.  It has a talent system, and two professions from which you can choose.  You’ve got a wide variety of classes from rogues to warriors to mages to warlocks.  All around, WoW is just plain fun.  You can do instances (dungeons and such) with your friends, or enjoy some relaxing fishing alone.  You can explore the land or do quests.  You can join a group for some amazing PvP, or go to a role-playing server to immerse yourself within the World of Warcraft (I have tried an RP server and the role-players for the game are very enthusiastic).  WoW even has one of the biggest maps I have ever seen.  To explore the entire map easily takes weeks just walking from place to place.  I am still debating which game’s map is bigger, WoW or Guild Wars, and I have yet to come to a conclusion.  To tell you what WoW holds in store would take pages upon pages more of a review.  However, this is not how WoW differentiates itself among other RPG’s.  You can get all of this stuff on other MMO’s, so what’s so special about this one?</p>
<p>What WoW does is it takes the simplicity of console RPG’s and mixes it with expansive environment, controls, character customization, and social abilities of the MMO world.  In simpler terms: WoW is easy, it eliminates the frustrations of other MMO’s, and simply makes the game just plain fun.  I was once a player of another MMORPG.  That was the game <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/5403/dark-age-of-camelot/">Dark Age of Camelot</a>.  While I was playing it, I thought it was an okay experience.  However, I now realize what a terrible experience it truly was.  While games like those are far too hard and required hours of work, WoW is simple, clean, and so easy to use that casual gamers can easily be on the same level as hardcore addicts.</p>
<p>WoW appeals to casual and hardcore gamers alike.  New players can begin enjoying the full experience as soon as they start, and it’s a huge and welcoming change for the RPG franchise.  It makes it feel like you aren’t too low of a level to get the games full potential.  Quests and monsters are just the right level of difficulty, making it easy for a person to just jump right into combat.  Epic quests do not require hours of time devoted to playing the game.  Even as early players, noobs can enjoy the same features as many players who are 50 levels above them.  The fun begins as soon as you log in.</p>
<p>Casual players are rewarded heavily in this game, because soloing is possible, easy, and rewarding.  Players who don’t play as often, will become “well-rested” while they are logged out, allowing them to gain double the experience as players who play all the time.  It is this welcoming incentive that continues to draw me into WoW, and finally I am no longer penalized for enjoying doing the quests alone and sporadically.  </p>
<p>Even early in the game players can enjoy a slew of highly entertaining skills and abilities, and each level you gain significantly adds a number of new abilities at your disposal.  This makes combat throughput the game fun and different, as you have tons of skills at your disposal to toy around with.  Both items that new players can use and higher experienced ones are distributed pretty much perfectly throughout the game, making finding a weapon perfectly suited for you as easy as walking down to a shop or slaying a beast.  Early players have the ability to choose the same professions as later players, which makes getting to the higher levels easier for new players.  The game makes noobs feel welcome.  As I said before, new and casual players can begin enjoying the full experience as soon as they start, and it’s a huge and welcoming change for me.</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons WoW is so welcoming to casual and new players its how it practically eliminates all of the frustrations of other MMO’s.  One of these things that comes to mind for me is grinding.  WoW utilizes the simple system that has been a requisite for console RPG’s for years: it allows the player to gain levels while they are adventuring.  Simply put: no grinding.  Read that again.  Eventually it hits you in this game that you never have to stop what you’re doing to bolster your stats.  It is easy to gain a level once or even twice per day, even between on and off adventuring and exploring.  You may even be able to achieve more levels that, if you really play it that much every day, only trying to level.  Most of the time, the leveling is done while your adventuring and on quests, making repetitive monster-slaying trials and experience quests almost non-existent in WoW.  Doing simple tasks such as gathering ingredients for a recipe do not require hours of work.  Developing skills can be easily done by the most casual or newest of players.  These reasons and many more are good reasons to get WoW.  It has so many elements that are nice and user-friendly that makes it fun to play without making it a complete chore.</p>
<p>Another one of these features that comes to mind is that death brings no toll to those unfortunate to have to go through it.  Your only punishment is that you must bring your dead spirit from a nearby graveyard (there is usually one or two in every region) to your corpse, which is a trivial walk.  It does not require you to lose points or skills, or require you to pray at some alter to get your stats to full potential.  I cannot being to explain how great this makes the game, being able to actually “play” without having to worry about taking risk.  I could sit here for hours iterating stories of how I’ve lost days of experience (from grinding no less) simply by accidentally aggroing some monster that is a couple levels higher than me.  This feature is a god-send, and you will praise Blizzard for making such an amazing decision in the game design.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental reasons of the underlying simplified gameplay I mentioned before is the clean character and item management.  WoW is not as ambiguous as many other MMO’s.  The system of professions, talents, pets, classes and other sorts are semi-self contained.  Its easy to use interface contains just a few menus and an action bar, and each menu serves major purposes.  All your professions, stats, pets, and other things are all tabbed in one menu for your character, while everything pertaining to social (guilds, friends) are all tabbed under another.  It keeps the screen clean of anything that gets in the way and makes it easy to find what you are looking for.  Looting is simple, even in massive groups.  You can easily discern which professions go with which, and character class limitations are well-defined.  Items aren’t vague as to what they are used for or what they add to your stats.  Many games I have played include strange numbers and stats that I have no idea what they do.  In WoW, almost every item is useful, so if you find something on an item, its usually used for something pertaining to a quest and will tell you so.  If its armor, a quest item, and weapon, or just food, it will tell you, which makes item handling much easier, as you feel like your not throwing away something very important when you clean out your inventory.   In WoW, what things do are so clearly defined it will make you wonder how the Hell other MMO’s didn’t think of doing this sooner.   </p>
<p>And as mentioned before, WoW is incredibly user friendly.  All around, WoW makes it easy for new users to gain ranks and earn experience, and still keeps everyone challenged.  Socially, the people you meet in game are some of the kindest people on the internet.  The role-playing servers can be lots of fun for those looking for a Dungeons and Dragons type of game, while the regular servers have people who are always willing to help out new players or go on raids or quests.  The Blizzard Support must also be duly noted.  If you seem to have an annoyance within the game, it’s as if Blizzard reads your mind and fixes it the next day.  It almost seems as if the Blizzard staff plays the game themselves, and sees what annoys them that must be fixed.  Blizzard constantly releases automatic updates that fix small bugs and glitches to make for a better gaming experience.  Server crashes are fixed within minutes, and problems with servers are usually fixed within hours to get the servers back up and running.  It’s simply amazing how well they treat their players.  Blizzard definitely goes to great lengths to make sure you are completely satisfied with your gaming, and you can surely tell.</p>
<p>Aside, the game’s great atmosphere also perks you up.  The graphics of the game are astounding and pleasing to the eye.  The graphics almost remind me of a fairy-tale:  colorful and beautiful landscapes with exaggerated features and rounded textures.  The trees in the game can be a host of colors like blue or purple, and the cities are magnificent.  The gates of cities are stories tall, and the streets are curvy, twisted, and almost cartoon-like.  The cheery yet atmospheric music adds greatly to this.  Above all, the atmosphere does something for your brain.  When you look out upon a bouncy forest of bright trees that are the size of skyscrapers, it makes you feel warm inside.  Even some of the more “evil” environments have vivid palettes and continue to have bouncy textures and exaggerated landscapes that make them feel more alive.  Other MMO’s, for some reason, like to include some desolate wasteland with destroyed cities, hopeless people, and an atmosphere that makes everyone seem dead.  WoW, however, does just the opposite.  The bright, cheery characters and environments do more to bring up your spirits.  Instead of drawing on dark, desolate feelings, they inspire feelings of warmth, happiness, and liveliness, almost as if the very air itself is alive.  Because of this, WoW is a game that will drawn you in and keep your there for hours on end.</p>
<p>They call this game the “World” of Warcraft for a reason.  All around, this game feels like a living, breathing thing.  If you let it, WoW can become your second home.  The colorful characters and world, the uncountable number of things to do, and the infinite character and profession combos will ensure that WoW has near endless replay value.  Hell, all I do is questing and instances, and that still manages to take up all of my day.  I’ve barely touched PvP, raids, and end-game quests, and yet I still fill my day with fun-filled questing in the world of Azeroth.  Let WoW charm you to death as you discover all of the games little quirks, interesting characters, fun story arcs.  No matter where you are or what you’re doing, there are always other people on, doing other things, and there is always something going on.  And as you play, you will become part of that rich tapestry which has practically evolved into its own society.  Invite yourself into the World of Warcraft, and you may never want to leave.<br>

A-D-D-I-C-T<br>
A-D-D-I-C-T<br>
And ADDICT was his name-O!</p>
<p>More and more these days video game addiction is a major problem.  People have reported to leave work, school, relationships, and even families over video games.  Some have even reportedly committed suicide.  The idea of a video game worse than drugs is scary, but it today’s world I find that it is honestly a very real entity. This game does not seem to erode this idea.  World or Warcraft is addicting, with a capital ‘A’.  For some, it’s because you feel that you have to keep playing hours to get “just one more level”, or you feel that you may miss something.  But also, it’s because World of Warcraft is utterly and uncontrollably fun to play.  Between quests, raids, dungeon runs and profession training, time slips away at a mind-boggling pace.  The first two days after I got this seem nothing but a blur.  Yes, the sad truth is that I spent a two full days, over 10 hours each day, playing the game from the time I got up until about midnight.  What’s weirder is that I did not actually realize that this time was slipping away.  When I emerged from my basement, I wondered where the time had all gotten to.  At that point I realized that time consumption was a factor I needed to seriously consider while playing WoW.  That’s something very new for me, a person who generally plays video games and socializes in moderation.  WoW, however, affects ALL gamers.  It has been called names like “World or Warcrack.”  It’s something to deeply consider when buying or playing this game.  Don’t put a video game in front of family.  Consider how much time you have before buying this.  Hell, make sure you consider how much time you have when you’re in the middle of playing it!  As my friend Pete (a dedicated WoW player and someone I actually played the game with) says, “WoW destroys lives”.  And it’s true.  Consider what you are going to give up for this game.  Many gamers may find it easy to play in moderation, but even those who don’t normally have addictive personalities can exhibit WoW addictions and late-night sessions.  People with addictive personalities should avoid the game altogether.</p>
<p>As the game drifts on you may notice that the quests are very much uninspired.  Unlike traditional one-player console RPG’s, the quests are pretty mindless.  Quests are almost always a “kill-quest”, where you either have to kill a certain number of monsters or a specific one.  Occasionally you will get an item collecting quest, which invariably leads to having to kill a number of monsters just to get those items.  Traveling quests are a nice and easy change but hardly offer anything fun or interesting.  If the game did not make up for itself with good combat, quests would be a nightmare.  Perhaps that’s why the game gets so much better when playing with a friend.  Related to this is the fact that the game can be very repetitive when played alone or “solo”.  Quests are almost always alike, and seem to be big repetitions of each other.  As a result, restarting characters is a nightmare since you will invariable be replaying dull missions that you had to do with other characters.  Quests are easily the least entertaining part of the game, and while they offer plenty of experience, are only bearable up to about level 30, where they become a terrible pain.  An unfortunate factor that must also be taken into account is that all of the game’s story is driven by quests, and that the game really lacks direction without them.  Bummer.</p>
<p>The patches are also one of the most major problems.  Blizzard frequently releases patches for this game.  All around it does much more good than it does bad, however the downloads are incredibly annoying.  Of course, for your convenience you do not have to keep track of versions or go to download sites.  It’s all done automatically by the in-game updater.  However, patches can be released almost once every two weeks.  And while the small ones are pretty much an annoyance rather than a pain (15 minutes isn’t all too bad), the larger ones are a nightmare, with up to an hour (or more!) or download times.  This only makes it worse for players installing and playing the game for the first time.  All of the patches created before that point must be downloaded, meaning 4 or 5 patch downloads (sometimes to avoid lengthy downloads they take older patches and incorporate them into the new ones so they don’t have to be downloaded).  Usually one or two of these is the nightmare patch mentioned above.  And while load times are swift and painless, prepare for a monstrous install time, and even more waiting just to get the game patched up running…
<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>World of Warcraft is a landmark in MMO design.  In my honest opinion, MMO’s have too long been bogged down by boring grinding, terrible adventuring, and annoying features and controls.  WoW eliminates all of these things, keeping what makes the game fun, and this is what appeals to me and 7 million other gamers so much.  It’s the fun a video game should give you, without all the tiresome work that come along with other MMO’s.  It’s incredibly friendly, incredibly fun, incredibly imaginative, and incredibly addicting.</p>
<p>And even to mention all of the great content that WoW offers would take a lifetime.  Things like professions, talents, all of the classes, a HUGE world to explore and tons of social interactivity make WoW my choice MMORPG.  But I could never tell you about everything, so let’s just leave it at that.  It’s up to you to discover all the amazing possibilities and the rich gameplay that the World of Warcraft is just waiting to offer.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>This is, by far, the best MMORPG currently out there and you hear many in the game saying the same when comparing to all other MMORPGs they have played.  Although the graphics may not compare with ones like FFIX, they fit the game universe perfectly.  The <i>somewhat</i> cartoony look to various creatures and characters is what you would expect in a Warcraft game.</p>
<p>The game is set up in such a way that quests will build your character up to a good level, then move you on to the next area, and so on.  You have the choice of not doing all of the quests, but doing so reveals the story and plot in the game as well as helping to keep your level where it should be for the area you are in.</p>
<p>Professions in the game are great, though not perfect.  Depending on your character's class, you pick from the various professions to select 2 that are going to be useful either to you or to your guild members... or just so you can make money off them.  The professions can help you to have better equipment than you usually can find for your character, though not always.  If you keep your professions' skills increasing, you can make some powerful items.  And the minor professions -- fishing, cooking, and first aid -- help to give you some more to do.  Fishing, in particular, can be very useful.  Besides getting fish that can be used for health, feeding pets, or cooking to make even better, you can also catch equipment.  Sometimes this can gain you some excellent equipment.</p>
<p>The enemies and varied considerably in the game.  No matter how long you play the game, as long as you aren't staying in the same area, you will find many new enemies to fight that look vastly different from previous ones.  Granted, spiders look similar, wolves look similar, etc... but you also find many enemies that look completely different.</p>
<p>Each race and class have special abilities and skills that define them.  These help you to create your own unique character that is different from everyone else's characters.  And the vast amount of equipment available also help to change how your character looks compared to everyone else.  Once you're out of the beginner areas, you don't usually see two characters who look the same.</p>
<p>The emotes included with the game are fun to mess around with when you want a break from killing.  The best of which is dancing.  Each race and gender have their own unique dancing style... from the human female doing the macarena, to the undead male appearing to be a hard rock star.  Getting many races and genders together to dance can make for a very interesting display.</p>
<p>The world is absolutely huge.  It would take a very long time to see the entire world, if you wanted to try and do so.  It can be deceiving when you look at the default map, because it seems small.  However, when you zoom it out all the way, you notice how huge it really is.  I have no idea really how big the world is, but I would estimate it to be over 500 miles x 500 miles (or 250,000 square miles)... and it may be even larger than that.  For a game world, that is ridiculously huge!  And that size helps keep areas from being too filled up with people.</p>
<p>Because of the number of classes and races available and because people want to try them all out and also be on multiple servers, the game allows you to have 10 characters on any one server, with a maximum of 50 characters.  For most people, this basically allows you to have as many as you want, since most don't want more than 50 characters.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>If you have a problem, GMs take a very long time to respond.  This is perhaps the worst issue with the game as it is still new and problems can happen more frequently now than they will in months to come.</p>
<p>Some quests require you to loot, or kill, a specific enemy, and when you have 20 people trying to complete the quest, this can take forever before you manage to get the kill so you can loot it.  You can group with others and that can help, but it still can become troublesome.</p>
<p>Lag is an issue in the game, but usually not a huge problem most of the time.  When it DOES hit, however, it can be severe.  Blizzard is working to correct that and may have it taken care of soon.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>If you like MMORPGs and don't mind paying some money for monthly access, this game is the best one you'll find.  I don't usually play games with monthly fees because it's not worth the cost to keep playing the game.  However, this game is so great that, for under $0.50 per day, it's worth the cost.  I can actually sit and play the game for 6-8 hours a night, every night... and many play much more than that!</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>I've been an adventure and role-playing game player for nearly three decades. I witnessed the pioneering of graphical gaming and every leap and bound of technology ever since. And almost every great adventure game or RPG in the history of PC gaming has a place of reverence on my shelf. But until June of 2006, I had never played an MMORPG.</p>
<p>When I logged onto World of Warcraft for the first time, I was awed and enthralled. The universe that unfurled before me was overwhelming - a real virtual reality, with 24 hour days, sunrises and sunsets, a calendar with celebrations and events that occur only on certain days of the year... I was convinced I had seen the undeniable future of role-playing gaming as we knew it.</p>
<p>However, mine was a novelty that was soon to fade, and when it did, it faded hard and fast...<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>As I played on over the months, small bothersome things began to come to my attention. Individually, or even in small numbers, these could be seen as the small quirks every game has - no game is ever 100% perfect in every player's eyes, of course. But these flaws began to multiply, and rapidly. And they were issues not just with the game itself, but with the very concept of the game. Too numerous to mention all of them, these little problems ranged from droll terrains, to poor character class balance, to ridiculously unrealistic area transitions. But worse, was the side of humanity that World of Warcraft not only attracted, but amplified and gloried in. Truly, my years in chat rooms, IRC channels, and weblogs never prepared me for the level of pure human stupidity that gravitates to WoW like iron filings to a magnet. Soon enough, 'phrases' like "cn i hav sum gold plz???", "rofl omg u sux0r!!!!1", and the inevitable "cn sum1 plz run me thru rfc PLZZZZ???" soon took their toll on my sanity, to the point where some days, I truly wanted to go on a postal rampage, killing all members of the same species who could manifest that mentality.</p>
<p>But, alas, perhaps that's simply the nature of online gaming. With World of Warcraft being the only MMORPG I had ever played (and because of it, now likely ever will!), I can't say with certainty that this is a failure of this game, or just this genre. But by contrast, the flaw which I found to be the worst failing of World of Warcraft, can most certainly not be blamed on the pathetic mental acuity of its players.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft is - and I state this with great vehemence - the dullest, most boring, most unimaginative, repetitive excuse for a "role playing game" I have experienced in nearly three decades of gaming.</p>
<p>When you play an RPG, one expects there to be puzzles, or quests, and solutions to these. In RPGs like <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/eye-of-the-beholder-series">Eye of the Beholder</a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/baldurs-gate-series">Baldur's Gate</a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/fallout-series">Fallout</a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/neverwinter-nights-series">Neverwinter Nights</a>, and so on, one is prompted to use one's creative and logical mind to solve each quest. Some are simple, some are challenging, some are downright complex, some are even funny or clever or ironic.</p>
<p>But in World of Warcraft, though there are literally thousands upon thousands of quests to be completed in the world of Azeroth, there is ultimately only one solution to them all: Kill X monsters, and/or collect Y loot from their corpses.</p>
<p>I need to emphasize this again for clarity - the ENTIRE GAME is comprised of people telling you go somewhere, kill a predetermined number of things, and often bring back a number of things, usually dismembered body parts or items they may be carrying, to the questgiver.</p>
<p>For example: Kill 12 gray bears, and collect 12 bear hearts. Or, collect 15 tail feathers from slain swoop birds. Or, collect 8 tiger's claws, 6 bird's eggs, and 15 spider's legs.</p>
<p>And this is how THE ENTIRE GAME goes on...</p>
<p>To make things even worse, often, the percentage chance that you will find one of the required items on the corpse of your enemy (aka. the "drop rate") is unrealistically and infinitesimally low. And, the further you get into the game, the lower these drop rates get. In the very beginning, you may only have to slay six tigers to get six tiger's claws. But by level 30 or 40, you'll find yourself having to spend three straight hours killing dozens upon dozens of raptors just to make your quota of the 8 lousy raptor eyes you need for the quest. Not only does this repetitive and mind-mushing grinding eventually wear one's soul down to a longing for blessed death, but the lack of realism is vile to witness. I mean, let's face it - granted, in the fury and carnage of battle, it's fair to assume that not every creature that meets your sword, axe, or gun, is going to come away with it's carcass intact. Things like paws or eyes, perhaps even hearts, may just be unsalvageable. But when the quest calls for you to return with the creature's entire head, or even, in several cases, a sample of its <b>blood</b>, and yet still only one in every fifteen kills yields you the rewards, well, that just starts to make me angry.</p>
<p>And that's only the half of it. As you progress to the highest echelons of the character levels, the need for mindless grinding becomes positively unimaginable. For some quests, you have to collect around <b>three thousand</b> pieces of unrefined metal ore to improve your reputation with a particular faction just so that they'll allow to shop in their stores. In others, you have to collect several hundred of a crystal that is only dropped by the end boss of a dungeon, or "instance" - and even then, only dropped sometimes!! - in a dungeon which can only be completed by a 40 man "raid group", which is essentially 40 players working as a team to complete the dungeon. So, <b>IF</b> you and 39 of your friends clear the instance, and <b>IF</b> you kill the boss, and <b>IF</b> he drops the item, and <b>IF</b>, by group consensus or a fair dice roll, you are the one allowed to have it as opposed to the other 39 people who might want it, then you have <b>ONE</b>. Then you only need several dozen more before you can complete the first part of that quest!!</p>
<p>Personally, I would rather be forced at gunpoint to remove my own genitals with a rusty spoon without anesthesia than to even attempt a grind of that magnitude.</p>
<p>The more I played World of Warcraft, the more I felt my will to live slipping away. When I heard on the news about the teenager who committed suicide as a result of the game, I couldn't even muster a glimmer of surprise. Every day, faced with the constant spamming of utterly illiterate children shouting "WTF LOL NO U R TEH NOOB STFU!!!!!" at eachother, while I trudged out the city gates to spend another hour hacking at animals for another few lousy pieces of silver and a small dose of experience, I wondered to myself, "Why am I paying $15 a month to torture myself with what is the equivalent of working in a sweat shop while being forced to watch 40 straight hours of reality television?".</p>
<p>When I discovered no answer to that question, after weeks of soul searching, I canceled my World of Warcraft account.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>When I came to MobyGames today to post this bleak review of the worst game I've played in over a quarter of a century, I read first a glowing review posted by <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=3682/">Corey Cole</a>, a man whom I once positively idolized as the co-creative legend, with wife <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,3681/">Lori-Ann Cole</a>, behind the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/quest-for-glory-series">Quest for Glory</a> series, which was the pinnacle of role playing adventure games of its time. When I read that this man, whose inspirational work on computer game development shaped a large part of my life, was now a self-confessed WoW addict, I honestly nearly wept. The notion that he and Lori, the hearts and minds behind Erasmus's Mage's Maze, the shimmering sands of the lands of Shapeir, the mentally and emotionally charging land of Tarna, and so much more, are now grinding day and night in this tiresome game hurts me to my soul. The <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/quest-for-glory-iii-wages-of-war/adblurbs">blurb on the back of the box</a> for <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/quest-for-glory-iii-wages-of-war">Quest for Glory III: Wages of War</a> says, "And if you succeed, it will be because you cut to the core of the mystery with your mind, not because you managed to sort through a series of stats or slashed through a thousand mindless monsters.". But that is precisely how you succeed in World of Warcraft. You slash through some monsters. And then you slash through a thousand more. And then, when you've done that, you move to another region, and slash through a few thousand more. Rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget to pick up their heads, on the off-chance that they drop them. Remember, you'll need to take a few dozen of those back to your questgiver to "solve" the "quest".</p>
<p>I'd rather just withdraw $15 from my bank account each month, and set fire to it.</p>

    <h3>1001 Video Games</h3>
<p><i>World of Warcraft</i> appears in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Video_Games_You_Must_Play_Before_You_Die" rel="nofollow">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a> by General Editor Tony Mott.</p>
<h3>Board game</h3>
<p>This game has been adapted into a (less massively-multiplayer -- 2-6 players instead) <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17223/world-of-warcraft-the-boardgame" rel="nofollow">2005 boardgame</a>.</p>
<h3>Christmas events</h3>
<ul><li>For the 2004 Christmas season, Blizzard added easter eggs throughout the game in a patch, which enabled players to find egg nog recipes, snowballs and various other references to Christmas.</li>
<li>In the 2005 Christmas event, several new NPCs and quests were added for a short period of time. One of the quests requested that you rescued Metzen the Reindeer - try searching for Chris Metzen on Mobygames and you'll see that he is from the Blizzard staff.</li></ul>
<h3>Development (post-release)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Blizzard">Blizzard</a> developed a program called <i>The Warden</i> to fight off cheaters. It's a highly-intrusive watchdog program, some even call it spyware, that scans for active processes while playing World of Warcraft. By accident, a DRM protection from the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Sony">Sony</a> record company helped crackers to avoid detection by The Warden.</p>
<p>Sony's DRM, shipped with tens of thousands of audio CD's, installs a virus-like rootkit that causes processes starting with $sys$ to stay undetected at all times. Malicious users with the DRM installed then simply wrote software with a $sys$ process to cheat in-game. With a booming economy and a gold price on eBay that easily matches the currency of some foreign countries, certain players will be rich soon.</p>
<p>In November 2005, Blizzard opened six new realms for the game in North America to give first time players the opportunity to adventure on equal footing with other players.</p>
<h3>Gnomeregan</h3>
<p>In every punch card you get in Gnomeregan, there is a hidden binary message:<br></p>
<p>White Punch Card:<br>
Thrall and Jaina sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G<br></p>
<p>Yellow Punch Card:<br>
If you can read this, you're standing too close<br></p>
<p>Blue Punch Card:<br>
The gnome king wears night elf underwear<br></p>
<p>Red Punch Card:<br>
Help! I'm trapped in a binary punch card factory!<br></p>
<p>Prismatic Punch Card:<br>
Message to Castpipe: your laundry's ready for pickup.</p>
<h3>Great Azeroth Plague, The</h3>
<p>In September 2005, Blizzard added a seemingly innocent instance with unexpected consequences of epic proportions. To a certain extent, it even became one of the most realistic events in a MMORPG to mimic the world and history itself.</p>
<p>The new instance, Zul'Gurub, features the god of blood: Hakkar. When you fight him, he has a debuff called Corrupted Blood, a disease that deals 250-350 damage every two seconds and affects nearby players. Unexpectedly, some players managed to carry the disease, soon dubbed <i>wow aids</i>, <i>hakkar sars</i> and <i>The Great Azeroth Plague</i>, outside the instance and brought it to the towns. It soon became a real plague, affecting thousands of players, of which many did not have the class to constantly protect themselves. Even npcs and pets became affected and low-level players were killed over and over again, as, after respawning, they were immediately struck once more.</p>
<p>The plague became so powerful that major cities became places to avoid. The GMs first tried to quarantine the players, but some kept escaping until it could no longer be controlled. From a small annoyance, it soon became a survival of the fittest where certain players found themselves unable to continue playing under normal circumstances. Ultimately, the plague lasted two days until a rolling restart of all servers.</p>
<p>This was not the first time something unexpected was taken outside an instance, though.</p>
<p>What is not commonly known is that the CDC (Center for Disease Control) in Atlanta contacted Blizzard about the plague in the game. The CDC had read that Blizzard had simulated a plague spreading through the world, and was interested in how they simulated it. They were disappointed when they found out it was a bug. </p>
<h3>Leeroy Jenkins</h3>
<p>A <i>World of Warcraft</i> gameplay video by the clan <i>PALS FOR LIFE</i> has spawned the internet phenomenon Leeroy Jenkins. You can read all about it in the Wikipedia article in the related links section.</p>
<h3>Money</h3>
<p>214,748 gold, 36 silver, 48 copper seems to be the maximum amount of money you can collect per character in WOW. As they informed in <a href="http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/01/16/apparently-you-can-have-too-much-gold/" rel="nofollow">wowinsider</a>, at least two different players, <a href="http://www.wowinsider.com/media/2008/01/691k3knjwh.jpg" rel="nofollow">Dorgabas</a> and <a href="http://www.wowinsider.com/media/2008/01/avaezf4bx3kpl2lrrjwh.jpg" rel="nofollow">meth</a> would have reached this limit on January 16th, 2008, a limit theorized before. After reaching this limit, your character can no longer receive money from any source in the game.</p>
<h3>Novel</h3>
<p>A <i>World of Warcraft</i> novel was published by Pocket Books in 2006: <i>Cycle of Hatred</i> by Keith R. A. DeCandido. It takes place in the period between between <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/9685/warcraft-iii-the-frozen-throne/">Warcraft III - the Frozen Throne</a> and World of Warcraft, filling in blanks and establishing greater continuity.</p>
<p>As of 2012, there are eight novels based on <i>World of Warcraft</i> (plus four based on the expansion <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/51579/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/">World of Warcraft: Cataclysm</a>).</p>
<h3>References</h3>
<ul><li>If you look carefully while playing the game, you may find developers or their families among the NPCs, such as <moby developer="Robert Bridenbecker">Robert Bridenbecker's</moby> family in Goldshire, just outside of Stormwind.</li>
<li>In Uldaman there are 3 lost dwarves: Olaf, Eric and Baelog.
Those 3 dwarves are all from the game <moby game="The Lost Vikings">The Lost Vikings</moby>.
And on top of that, The "Staff of Tsol" and the "Medallion of Gni'kiv" (which are both used on another quest in the same dungeon) spelled backwards "Tsol" and "Gni'kiv" are "Lost" and "Viking".</li>
<li>When playing a Horde character at level 40+ with 225/225 in your First Aid skill, travel to Hammerfall.
Go to the Trauma Surgeon in the building to the left of the entrance. He will give you a quest in which you can gain Artisan First Aid.
In this quest, you must run around and bandage dying patients. When dying, one of the patients says: "Goodbye cruel world.. I'm leaving you today. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye".
Those are the exact lyrics of the song "Goodbye Cruel World" of Pink Floyd's "The Wall" album.</li>

<li>One of the quests in Netherstorm, Outland, is called <i>Needs More Cowbell</i> where the player needs to find the cow Bessy using a bell.
