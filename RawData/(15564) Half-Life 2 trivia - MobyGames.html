<p><em>Half-Life 2</em> appears in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Video_Games_You_Must_Play_Before_You_Die" rel="nofollow">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a> by General Editor Tony Mott.</p>
<h3>Characters</h3>
<p>Almost all the characters in <em>Half-Life 2</em> are modelled after a real person's appearance:
* Barney's face in the game was provided by Valve's CEO <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=5182">Scott Lynch</a>.
* Alyx Vance is modelled after American actress and television host <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/60805/jamil-giovanni-mullen/">Jamil Giovanni Mullen</a>.
* Eli Vance's is based on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Larry+Heard">Larry "The Count" Heard</a>, a local man holding a sign indicating that he was looking for work. Valve found him on the corner of Highway 520 and 148th Avenue in Redmond and hired him as a model.
* The G-Man's <em>Half-Life 2</em> model is based on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/157040/frank-sheldon/">Frank Sheldon</a>, an Alexander Technique practitioner. He was originally slated to be the model for Dr. Breen.</p>
<h3>City 17</h3>
<p>City 17, the main location of <em>Half-Life 2</em>, strongly resembles Eastern European and Soviet cities of the communist era; the architecture style of suburb districts is nearly identical to what can be see (even until now) in East Berlin, Prague, Moscow, etc. However, there is also more direct evidence to the "Soviet" nature of City 17; several times some Russian words can be spotted. For example, during the mud skipper chase there are large gates with the words <strong>ÐŸÐžÐ Ð¢</strong> written above; "Ð¿Ð¾Ñ€Ñ‚" is Russian for "port" (pronounced roughly the same way as the English word).</p>
<h3>Closed captions</h3>
<p>Valve designed <em>Half Life 2</em> with closed captioning for the deaf. Sounds are bracketed. Each character has a color assigned to their dialogue.</p>
<h3>Cut levels</h3>
<p>According to the book <em>Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar</em>, the original storyline spanned four in-game days instead of just three. Among the parts cut are an antlion cave, a train ride through a dried out sea bed, a ship called the "Borealis", the underwater "Kraken Base", a Combine weather control station, a chapter set in arctic regions and a skyscraper. Many of these places show up in pre-release screenshots and press material.</p>
<p>Some parts were recycled for existing <em>Half-Life 2</em> chapters, many others are making a comeback in the <em>Half-Life 2</em> episodes.</p>
<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p>The PC version of <em>Half-Life 2</em> was the last game that Sierra distributed for Valve at retail. Electronic Arts was quick to scoop up the retail deal, but their Steam digital distribution service remains independent.</p>
<p>As a result of a settlement in a lawsuit between <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Valve">Valve</a> and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Vivendi+Universal+Games">VU Games</a>, VU Games ceases distribution of retail packaged versions of Valve's games (including <em>Half-Life 2</em>), effective August 31, 2005.</p>
<h3>Engine</h3>
<p>Despite the complex graphics, including ragdoll physics and pixel shaders, the Source engine was designed to support cards that offer only DirectX 6 hardware support. The original Source engine code would run by using the software emulation encoded in the DirectX 9 library. That means that the game can be run even with an Intel 846g card or a Nvidia TNT chipset. To give some perspective, The TNT chipset was introduced in 1997.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/682/john-carmack/">John Carmack</a> himself, "there are still bits of early <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Quake">Quake</a> code in <em>Half Life 2</em>". </p>
<h3>German version</h3>
<p>There are changes in some German versions:
* Blood from humans (including Gordon Freeman) and blood which is part of the level design was coloured grey
* Almost all enemies disappear instantly after being killed. This is not true for a level near the end where the corpses are necessary to proceed.
* The cries of burning zombies were toned down
* In the original version enemies get dragged with the buggy for a short time after driving over them. In the German version the buggy just drives through them.</p>
<p>A detailed list of changes can be found on <a href="http://www.schnittberichte.com/schnittbericht.php?ID=4610" rel="nofollow">schnittberichte.com</a> (German).</p>
<h3>G-Man</h3>
<p>G-Man can been spotted in a few places throughout the game, as he is watching over Gordon or walking around.</p>
<h3>Hydra</h3>
<p>An enemy that was shown in early previews known as the hydra, which was a blue tentacle, was cut out of the final game. The developers said that it was good to watch, but when it came to kill you, you would just see a blue blur and you would be dead. They didn't think it would be fun to fight against.</p>
<h3>Macintosh version</h3>
<p>In September of 2007 Valve's <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/22354/gabe-newell/">Gabe Newell</a> was <a href="http://games.kikizo.com/features/gabenewell_valve_iv_sep07_p1.asp" rel="nofollow">interviewed</a> by gaming website Kikizo's Adam Doree about the then shortly to be released <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Orange+Box">Orange Box</a>, asking, among other things, about the potential for a Macintosh release. Newell responded by saying that though they had been in conversations with Apple regarding the possibility "they seem to think that they want to do gaming, but there's never any follow through on any of the things they say they're going to do. That makes it hard to be excited about doing games for their platforms." Thus, there wouldn't be a Macintosh version of <em>Half-Life 2</em>.</p>
<p>A month later, in October, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/540/tuncer-deniz/">Tuncer Deniz</a>, a Macintosh developer and owner of the news site Inside Mac Games, <a href="http://www.insidemacgames.com/features/tuncersblog.php?ID=111" rel="nofollow">posted on his blog</a> that while Newell's complaints likely weren't without justification, the actual reason for the lack of a Macintosh port was due to "Valve's insistence that anyone who wanted to port Half-Life 2 to the Mac had to advance $1 million to Valve. That's right, that's $1,000,000. That might be peanuts to someone like Valve, but no Mac publisher in their right mind would have given Valve that kind of money just for the rights to publish Half-Life 2 for the Mac."</p>
<p>A Macintosh version was finally released in 2010 when Steam, Valve's digital distribution platform, was introduced for Macintosh.</p>
<h3>Menu</h3>
<p>The background picture of the main menu changes based on what chapter you are at when you last saved.</p>
<h3>Multiplayer</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/15518/counter-strike-source/">Counter-Strike: Source</a> was the only multiplayer mode available at the release. Two weeks later, on November 30, 2004, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Valve">Valve</a> released the regular multiplayer mode (Deathmatch) through Steam, their online content distribution system.</p>
<h3>PiÃ±ata</h3>
<p>Several news sources first reported <em>Half-Life 2</em> entering gold status, quoting an unnamed source within the development team. The source revealed the existence of a piÃ±ata doll (a traditional South American custom of a doll stuffed with sweets and toys for children to break) which was broken to celebrate <em>HL2</em>'s official completion.</p>
<p>It was later revealed that this "piÃ±ata" was in fact a full-scaled Scanner model (the flying machines that take pictures of suspects in-game) and it was broken using a crowbar.</p>
<h3>Rating</h3>
<p>Even though the initial release of <em>Half-Life 2</em> as part of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/30577/the-orange-box/">The Orange Box</a> compilation received a PEGI rating of 16+, the stand-alone release received an initial rating of 18+.</p>
<h3>References</h3>
<p>Dr. Kleiner's pet headcrab Lamarr is actually named after Hedy Lamarr (November 9, 1913 â€“ January 19, 2000, born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler), an Austrian-Jewish naturalized American actress and communications technology innovator.</p>
<h3>References to the game</h3>
<p><em>Half-Life 2</em> was parodied in an episode of "Die Redaktion" (The Editorial Team), a monthly comedy video produced by the German gaming magazine GameStar. It was published on the DVD of issue 05/2006.</p>
<h3>Source code theft</h3>
<p>Sometime in September 2003 Valve's network - including Gabe Newell's own computer - was compromised by a hacker and the worst case scenario soon unfolded. The entire Half-Life 2 source code was released on October 4 and only 3 days later a playable version of the game surfaced. FBI was brought into the case, and Gabe Newell also posted a message on a Half-Life 2 forum, asking the community to help them find the hacker.</p>
<p>Months went by without any substantial progress, when finally on February 15 the hacker sent an e-mail to Gabe Newell, expressing both his compliments on Valve's work so far and his somewhat dodgy statement that he never had any intention to hurt Valve. Gabe Newell and the hacker, known as "Da Guy" from Germany corresponded over the next period of time, and came to the agreement that since Da Guy had been smart enough to compromise Valve's security, he deserved a job. Soon, a job interview was setup. This was of course a trick. FBI agents would be waiting for the German when he arrived. However, when the German government heard about the scheme they denied such activities, and instead they arrested him themselves.</p>
<p>Da Guy, aka Axel G now faces charges for compromising Valve as well as several other computer related crimes.</p>
