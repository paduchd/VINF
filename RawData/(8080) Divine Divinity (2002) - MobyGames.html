    <p>Two thousand years ago, the wise mages of the Council of Seven sacrificed themselves to save the land of Rivellon. A Divine Order was established in their memory, sworn to protect the land from forces of evil. Now, growing unrest, corruption, and greed indicate that evil is near. The protagonist wakes up in a house in Aleroth, the town of healers, without any recollection of what happened beforehand. It appears that the leader of the healers has gone mad. The hero is asked to find a way to cure his predicament, which leads to a confrontation with higher powers, and eventually to a grand quest to unite the heirs of the Council and face the ultimate evil in battle.</p>
<p><em>Divine Divinity</em> is a 2D action role-playing game with an oblique (rather than isometric) perspective, set in a fantasy universe. The game borrows certain elements from the <a href="/game-group/diablo-series">Diablo series</a>, most notably point-and-click action-oriented combat and item randomization. However, the game's locations are not randomized, and it contains many features of traditional role-playing games such as interaction with NPCs and multiple dialogue choices.</p>
<p>The entire game world consists of over twenty thousand screens, each one being a seamless transition into the next with weather effects as well as day and night cycles. The main quest progression is linear; however, there are plenty of sub-quests available, many with multiple solutions, and the main character is pretty much free to travel to most parts of the map right at the beginning. Also notable is the ability to loot almost anything, not just equipment or healing items, but also chairs, candle sticks, and pretty much anything that isn't nailed down (except tables).</p>
<p>In the beginning of the game, the player selects between three character classes for the protagonist, each coming in two variants (male or female): Warrior, Survivor, or Wizard. Each of these classes has four categories of unique skills. For example, the Wizard can specialize in elemental disciplines or choose the path of summoning various creatures, while Survivor skills include, among others, pickpocketing and alchemy. Each class can learn the skills of other classes, and the differences between them are mainly the starting skills and stat bonuses as they level up.</p>
<p>The game features a random item generator similar to, albeit less extensive than, <a href="/game/diablo">Diablo</a>. Items at certain locations have fixed names, but most attributes (like damage, armor rating, poison or stun effects, stat bonuses, or gem slots) are randomized. The player can also improve their weapons with gems dropped from enemies, or bought from shops; the dedicated player may even embark themselves on the quest to find the legendary weapons.</p>

The result is an exciting and addictive roleplaying game that will keep you at your computer in the wee hours of the morning for weeks.", "date": "2002-10-15", "edit_object_url": "/approval/edit-object?type=47\u0026oid=43922113", "grade": null, "id": 14378, "internal_url": "https://www.mobygames.com/game/8080/divine-divinity/reviews/#critic-score-14378", "language": "en", "max_score": 100.0, "normalized_score": 84.0, "platform": {"id": 3, "name": "Windows"}, "score": 84.0, "source": {"country": {"country_code": "us", "flag": "https://cdn.mobygames.com/9f436050-ab5e-11ed-b6d6-02420a000150.gif", "id": 1, "name": "United States"}, "description": null, "edit_object_url": "/approval/edit-object?type=46\u0026oid=49257678", "first_year": 1996, "id": 10, "internal_url": "https://www.mobygames.com/critic/10/gamespy/", "languages": [{"code": "en", "id": 36, "name": "English", "ordering": 360}], "last_year": null, "name": "GameSpy", "num_reviews": 4924, "url": "http://www.gamespy.com/"}, "submitter": {"id": 67079, "internal_url": "https://www.mobygames.com/user/67079/nyccrg/", "name": "nyccrg"}, "type": {"id": 1, "name": "Numeric (Highest score is best)"}, "url": "http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/october02/divinedivinity/"}, {"citation": "\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043c\u0443 Diablo \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0441 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b - \u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0442\u044c, \u043d\u043e Divine Divinity \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442 \u0438 \u0434\u043e \u0441 \u043d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435\u043c.", "date": "2002-11", "edit_object_url": "/approval/edit-object?type=47\u0026oid=44124415", "grade": null, "id": 53700, "internal_url": "https://www.mobygames.com/game/8080/divine-divinity/reviews/#critic-score-53700", "language": "ru", "max_score": 5.0, "normalized_score": 84.0, "platform": {"id": 3, "name": "Windows"}, "score": 4.2, "source": {"country": {"country_code": "ru", "flag": "https://cdn.mobygames.com/b1f886a8-ab5e-11ed-b6d6-02420a000150.gif", "id": 19, "name": "Russia"}, "description": null, "edit_object_url": "/approval/edit-object?type=46\u0026oid=49259566", "first_year": 1996, "id": 517, "internal_url": "https://www.mobygames.com/critic/517/gameexe/", "languages": [{"code": "ru", "id": 119, "name": "Russian", "ordering": 1190}], "last_year": 2006, "name": "Game.EXE", "num_reviews": 182, "url": "http://www.game-exe.ru/"}, "submitter": {"id": 56293, "internal_url": "https://www.mobygames.com/user/56293/virgil/", "name": "Virgil"}, "type": {"id": 1, "name": "Numeric (Highest score is best)"}, "url": null}, {"citation": "Cert este c\u0103 jocul merit\u0103 din plin aten\u021bia voastr\u0103, chiar dac\u0103 dup\u0103 aceea v\u0103 ve\u021bi \u00eentoarce la Diablo sau la Baldur\u0027s Gate.", "date": "2002-11", "edit_object_url": "/approval/edit-object?type=47\u0026oid=45682658", "grade": null, "id": 245622, "internal_url": "https://www.mobygames.com/game/8080/divine-divinity/reviews/#critic-score-245622", "language": "ro", "max_score": 100.0, "normalized_score": 83.0, "platform": {"id": 3, "name": "Windows"}, "score": 83.0, "source": {"country": {"country_code": "ro", "flag": "https://cdn.mobygames.com/b2514bd0-ab5e-11ed-b6d6-02420a000150.gif", "id": 48, "name": "Romania"}, "description": null, "edit_object_url": "/approval/edit-object?type=46\u0026oid=49257695", "first_year": 1999, "id": 554, "internal_url": "https://www.mobygames.com/critic/554/level/", "languages": [{"code": "ro", "id": 117, "name": "Romanian", "ordering": 1170}], "last_year": null, "name": "Level", "num_reviews": 160, "url": "http://www.level.ro/"}, "submitter": {"id": 203768, "internal_url": "https://www.mobygames.com/user/203768/giuseppe87/", "name": "Giu\u0027s Brain"}, "type": {"id": 1, "name": "Numeric (Highest score is best)"}, "url": null}, {"citation": "Divine Divinity was released in September of 2002.

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>
Divine Divinity is, without a doubt, a Diablo II clone. The whole game system is totally based off of it. Diablo II had a great system, however, and that makes this game very enjoyable. The one thing it doesnâ€™t share at all is the atmosphere-- in Divine Divinity, it's not dark and hopeless; the game has a much more friendly feel, almost uplifting compared to DII.</p>
<p>The game has three main classes, which, although they define your 'special ability' and your appearance (there are male and female versions of each class), do not lock you to their way. You can be a warrior with thief (survivor is the term used in the game... we all know the three classic archetypes) skills, or vice versa. The skill system is pretty interesting and open, and often you'll have three skills you want with only one skill point to put into them. That's a good thing-- nobody likes having half of their class skills be useless!</p>
<p>The game's visual appeal is very high. There are pool which reflect the area around them, adding a very 'lifelike' effect to the woodlands. The caves are dark, dank, slimy, and filled with pesky rats and other, more dangerous things. NPCs don't look too great, but they do okay.</p>
<p>The voice acting in the game is decent. It wasn't made by native English speakers, so it's actually pretty impressive, considering. It is still jarring to have someone say a sentence in the totally wrong tone of voice, however, and that often happens.</p>
<p>Music is a treat. The theme doesnâ€™t wear on you at all... sometimes I fire up the game just to listen to it. In the game, you often you won't even realize how much the background music adds to the ambience.</p>
<p>The game interface takes a little while to get used to, but it's simple and easy once you take the five minutes to master it. Combat is quick, simple hack'n'slash, but this is not a game where the first opponents you meet are easy-- instead of hordes of easy enemies, you will meet a moderate amount of fairly challenging foes. Don't think you won't encounter hordes at any point in the game, though-- you certainly do!</p>
<p>The game has many other little spots that make it fun, too. You can buy a house and move furniture around to decorate it just right. The game is also funny at many points-- I really laughed at a few, which is rare in games-- which adds to the sense of life.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Magic was actually a bit of a disappointment. Although the graphics are generally good, some of the magical effects are quite dull, and given that there aren't too horribly many of them, it's pretty bad having half your spells look odd.</p>
<p>The game seems to be easier for warriors than the other classes, but this isn't too much of an issue-- it poses a challenge to all the classes at many areas, and it only seems to be a little easier for swordswingers.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the voice acting can be painful at a few spots.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Divine Divinity is a very enjoyable hack'n'slash game with some special features . It is surprisingly open-ended with many neat and sometimes funny side-quests; this keeps it quite enjoyable throughout all the main quest. Recommended.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>Being very interested in game mechanics, Iâ€™ll start listing this gameâ€™s many good points with the huge amount of freedom you have in developing your character. Yes, there are three classes and your choice when you create your character does have certain effects, such as a wizard getting twice the amount of mana a warrior with the same intelligence would have or a warrior getting four times the damage bonus a wizard with the same strength would have, but you are completely free to raise those attributes however you wish and to pick any skills you think will better suit your playing style.<br>
Thatâ€™s right, all 96 skills are available to all three classes, so you can mix and match at will. Luckily, you will get a few skills for free over the course of the game and most mage skills can be learned from books, which can be found or bought, though the prices are steep. Even so, with each skill having five levels and the vast majority of the skills being useful, the 60 or so skill points you will obtain by the end of the game will need to be distributed carefully, making for several character development paths that could be just as good, depending on your playing style.</p>
<p>The game world is large and reasonably interesting as well. It will take a long time to explore every area, but you will likely find it worth your effort, as this game offers way more than swarms of enemies to kill and lots of nice loot to use or sell. Sure, there is a pretty insane amount of that as well, but there are also a whole lot of side-quests and even more NPCs that will have something to tell you, a fair portion of those discussions being quite humorous.<br>
And the music is excellent as well, adding a lot to the atmosphere of every section of the game. (For those who are interested, it is available for download from composer Kirill Pokrovsky's site. Though it loses its meaning when separated from the game, seeing as it was made to perfectly accompany the various areas you will end up exploring.)</p>
<p>Another interesting thing that I need to mention is the kind of information your journal provides. Sure, it does the usual job of keeping track of quests, but statistics regarding the exact number of enemies killed of each type are also available, including some of the attributes of each, which can be nice if you simply want to keep score but can also provide some useful information that you could use in preparing for future fights. Also, youâ€™ll be able to see some detailed information about your character on a screen that adds descriptions for each attribute, including your level and your resistances. And many of those descriptions will tend to be at least somewhat humorous, which to me says that the developers enjoyed making this game and wanted to provide the players with as many reasons as possible to enjoy playing it as well.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Likely the main issue has to do with the combat system. As one would expect, it closely follows the Diablo recipe, as many other games did as well, meaning that most fights just require you to click a button countless times. And sometimes you need to click that button as fast as you possibly can, for example if you are using the lightning spell, which hits the enemy instantly, so any fraction of a second lost between clicks translates into less damage done and therefore a higher likelihood of the enemy managing to hit back. That, coupled with the relatively small number of quickslots compared to the number of available skills, tends to diminish the positive value of such a varied and open character development system.</p>
<p>Another significant problem is the fact that the attributes of items are determined randomly when you first pass your mouse over them, the game only sticking to a general overall value of the item in question, roughly represented by the color of its name. So you may well need to first learn the location of any important items and then save before passing your mouse over them, reloading if the attributes you see are not suited for your playing style.<br>
Itâ€™s quite a tedious process, made worse by the fact that adding charms to items that have free slots is a permanent decision. That can cause quite a lot of frustration if you add your good charms to an item and a short while later find one thatâ€™s more useful for your particular playing style, even if perhaps its overall value would be lower, but also if you decide against adding any charms but fail to find a better item for a very long time, meaning that you struggled with weaker equipment for no reason.</p>
<p>I also need to make note of the size of the dungeons. The world itself is large and quite interesting, but the dungeons tend to get tedious after a while. And the real problem with that is that theyâ€™re absolutely huge, usually spanning several levels, each of those levels being large in itself. There are usually a few interesting moments in each, for example I still remember the skeleton who very bluntly hit on me, but for the most part youâ€™re just running through seemingly endless catacombs, fighting wave after wave after wave of enemiesâ€¦</p>
<p>And then you have the main story, which isnâ€™t noticeably better than youâ€™d expect from such games, being one you have likely heard hundreds of times before and will likely hear hundreds of times more in the future. Thankfully, the side-quests, NPCs and humor save a good part of the overall impression, but it would have been much better if the main story would have avoided at least a couple of clichÃ©sâ€¦<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>If memory serves, I played and finished this game at least two and a half years ago. Yet I still remember it quite fondly, perhaps even more so just because I actually played <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Diablo+II+Gold">Diablo II</a> shortly after it and that showed me just how much better Divine Divinity is in every aspect. Itâ€™s true that it takes the basic Diablo II recipe and builds upon it, but it adds a lot to that recipe and in doing so it does nearly everything right, while Diablo II did pretty much everything wrong. At least thatâ€™s my opinion, regardless of how many will be bothered by it.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite its flaws and the uninspired name, I certainly have to say that Divine Divinity is Diablo II done right. If item attributes wouldnâ€™t have been randomized, or at least not randomized so much, it would have probably been about as good as a game of this type could possibly ever be, seeing as the other problems are more or less inherent to the genre.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/608/ultima-vii-the-black-gate/">Ultima VII</a> remained an unsurpassed champion of 2D role-playing games in my eyes. Even after <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Fallout">Fallout</a> and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Baldur's+Gate">Baldur's Gate</a> gave a tremendous kick to the RPGs of the West a few years later, I always regarded <i>Ultima VII</i> as the Holy Grail of delicate balancing: it had a vast world and incredible interactivity, and yet was scripted and character-driven. <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Elder+scrolls">Elder Scrolls</a> games always went only for the first, while <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bioware">Bioware</a> focused mainly on the second. </p>
<p>A decade or so later, an unknown game created by modest Belgian developers challenged my definitions. <i>Divine Divinity</i> is a fantastic RPG that valiantly took upon itself the gigantic task of converging different sub-species of the genre. The developers have obviously studied the classics: <i>Ultima VII</i> was clearly the main source of inspiration for this project. For the first time since that milestone, a large, detailed world of similar magnitude has been realized in a 2D RPG. Tighter Bioware-style scripting was added to ensure smoother pace. On top of that, they added another important component: the addictive system of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1878/diablo-ii/">Diablo II</a> with its action-oriented combat, skill-based character development, and abundant variation of randomized items.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but the mere idea of such a game almost made me drool. Unfortunately, <i>Divine Divinity</i> was constantly marketed as a "Diablo clone", and my ambivalent feelings towards that series made me skip the game when it first came out. Regardless of anyone's opinion concerning Diablo games in general and its second incarnation in particular, it's hard to deny that wealth of items coupled with a skill system was a positive contribution to the development of the genre. <i>Divine Divinity</i> retains it but does away with the repetitiveness and lack of proper RPG features that distinguished Blizzard's creations. The game offers a wide variety of equipment to try out, as well as a large number of skills divided into three classes with four categories each. Each class can learn any skill with certain penalties applied, so the system is extremely flexible and will keep you starting at skill trees for a long while every time you consider where to invest your precious points.</p>
<p>Combat is handled the same way as in Diablo games, with a somewhat slower pace and noticeably lower frequency. I never disliked action-oriented combat, I just thought that Diablo games went over the top with the quantity. <i>Divine Divinity</i> is a great alternative to those who liked the uncomplicated joy of clicking on enemies but also wished to combine that pleasure with some other kind of gameplay. For a fan of serious RPGs <i>Divine Divinity</i> is indeed "Diablo done right", but that doesn't mean that you can't enjoy it even on the simplest level of gameplay mechanics. Walking through wilderness or exploring twisted dungeons and whacking enemy after enemy on the way while watching how your experience grows is a primal RPG sensation, and <i>Divine Divinity</i> captures it very well.</p>
<p>But that's just the tip of the iceberg. <i>Divine Divinity</i> has a large open world you can explore right away. You can start the game, exit the first house, go out of the gate and just start walking. Yes, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/779/ultima-ix-ascension/">Ultima IX</a> (and later <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3785/gothic/">Gothic</a> and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6280/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/">Morrowind</a>) also had vast worlds and they were much more impressive visually because they were done in 3D. But none of these games managed to combine the sheer size of a world with both detailed interactivity and believable characters. <i>Divine Divinity</i>, on the other hand, triumphantly succeeds in presenting a breathing, believable, enchanting world you'll want to explore to your heart's content. </p>
<p>Everything you see can be interacted with. You can blow candles, rearrange cutlery in other people's houses, stack boulders on a road, and make improvised beds out of straw. The glory of <i>Ultima VII</i> is back: you can once again march through towns, fields, and dungeons, and steal, move around, or simply poke everything you see. The world of <i>Divine Divinity</i> is beautifully busy: there is stuff everywhere, things you can reach out to and touch. You can literally forget everything the game tells you to do and just explore and collect items. I tried to delay plot-related activities simply because I wanted to be my own master in the game, and it allowed me to feel that way. Only few games have ever managed to captivate me in such a manner.</p>
<p>While <i>Morrowind</i> failed to simulate life-like situations with its robotic, sad NPCs, <i>Divine Divinity</i> once again gracefully brings back the natural liveliness of <i>Ultima VII</i>. Basically, no two characters are alike, and even the most ordinary people you encounter will tell you something that distinguishes them from the rest. The game is chock-full of side quests. Already in the first town you'll quickly meet people who will ask you to do something that has no relation to the main story. The quests range from simple delivery missions to fairly complex situations that can be tackled in different ways and require you to make a moral judgement. In its wealth of optional content and individualization of NPCs and quests <i>Divine Divinity</i> is close to Baldur's Gate games. </p>
<p><i>Divine Divinity</i> has plenty of something I value so much in games: attention to detail. For example, in the first town there is a tombstone of somebody who, according to the inscription, didn't like flowers. Taking advantage of the game's marvelous interactivity, I took some flowers and placed them on the tomb. I never expected anything to come out of that, but, amazingly, the game reacted and I was invited to a side quest of sorts. This is the kind of thing that shows how much heart was poured into the game. The developers' passion can be felt in every location, every aspect of the world's design. There is so much to see and to do, and the game is always generous to you. You won't see clearly cut-out, "streamlined" content, formulaic structuring, or lazy attitude that has plagued so many games, especially in this millennium. <i>Divine Divinity</i> is full of life and love, and it makes you love it simply by being what it is. </p>
<p>The game's story is not the most original tale out there, but it is kept fresh by all those sub-plots that add their own pieces to the puzzle. There is a sense of coherence and depth in the game's world and its lore, so discovering and learning more about that world prevail while the main plotline takes the back seat. There are a few neat twists in the story, and the lively supporting characters pull it out of the schematic mediocrity it sometimes deteriorates into. In any case, the meat and potatoes of the game's narrative-related content is not the main story itself, but the side quests and the characters associated with them. You'll plunge into a net of intrigues, romantic relationships, organizations, and all sorts of other stuff that make up for the old-fashioned "chosen one" storyline. </p>
<p><i>Divine Divinity</i> also has plenty of humor. In fact, while trying to take itself seriously in appropriate situations, it never passes on an opportunity to insert jokes and bits of amusing dialogue here and there. I was compelled to talk to every NPC simply because I expected them to say something funny. Humorous elements pervade even the main plot, with some eccentric characters such as the fabulous talking cat Arhu, and situations that bring the much-needed freshness and originality to the otherwise standard procedure: for example, the very first quest in the game involves curing a mad healer who seems to be frightened by cabbage. Even the description of your current primary character attributes manages to be funny.  </p>
<p>On top of all that, <i>Divine Divinity</i> has lovely, warm 2D graphics and fantastic music. Just wandering through peaceful rural areas while listening to the sweeping symphonic soundtrack is an experience that should not be missed. <i>Divine Divinity</i> presents a familiar medieval fantasy world in soft, pleasing, dreamy colors, and I was enticed by that interpretation. Even the dark dungeons are cozy rather than terrifying. This kind of atmosphere is hard to realize, and I was glad this game allowed me to plunge into it.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>The title. I saw this game in a store when it was first released and refused to buy it just because this Idiotic Idiocy was staring at me from the cover. Okay, title is really not an essential component of a game, but it is the first thing you see before you begin to learn  anything else about the game. And there is no way around it, <i>Divine Divinity</i> must be the one of the worst titles ever forced upon a great game.</p>
<p>The game's tendency to syncretism is quite obvious. <i>Divine Divinity</i> excels in everything it tries to put together, but doesn't really bring truly original ideas to the mix. This must be the reason for its lack of popularity and impact. By the time it came out RPG fans were already divided into several unpacified clans. Devoted Diablo adepts would be annoyed by the game's slower pace and complexity, while followers of Bioware tradition would frown upon its simple combat. The combination worked for me because I appreciate both styles and I loved the way the game was experimenting with them, but its ambitions probably worked against it as it was trying to satisfy everyone at once.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br><i>Divine Divinity</i> is more than just a pleasant surprise. The highly talented Belgian developers succeeded in blending venerable and popular RPG traditions in one titanic game. Marvelously interactive large world reminiscent of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/608/ultima-vii-the-black-gate/">Ultima VII</a>, addictive <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Diablo">Diablo</a>-style character-building, lively dialogues and story-driven structure similar to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Baldur's+Gate">Baldur's Gate</a> games - <i>Divine Divinity</i> has it all. It is a product of love and hard work, and a sumptuous dish for RPG gourmets across the globe.</p>

  <div id="trivia-text" class="text-break-word shrink-headings toggle-long-text">
    <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
<p>One of the in-game manuscripts depicts a dragon and a url encoded in some runic alphabet. Upon <a href="http://www.divinedivinity.net/divinity/files/rune_alphabet.exe" rel="nofollow">decoding</a>, you get the address <a href="http://www.valaraukar.de" rel="nofollow">www.valaraukar.de</a>, which links to graphics designer <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/109091/marian-arnold/">Marian Arnold's</a> personal website.</p>
<h3>Polymorph</h3>
<p>The 'Polymorph' spell is designed to transform an opponent into a harmless creature, such as a frog or a rabbit. After the transformation, you can easily kill the opponent. But try this: Polymorph a member of the Black Ring at your first encounter. For example, he/she is now a frog. Beat the frog and he/she will, as usual, escape. When Janus later summons his allies in a scripted scene, the polymorphed member will not appear in its normal form, but still as the frog, even when weeks have passed between those two encounters. </p>
<h3>References</h3>
<ul>
<li>On Janus's castle's roof, there's a skateboard, a ramp and fitting graffiti on the walls. You will need to use Elven sight to see it, though.</li>
<li>On the second level under the Warrior's Guild in the Dark Forest, there's an open slate in the west wing. The cursor doesn't change, buy you can go down. In the small room below, you will find the Kaa Gent scroll. It's useless, but the name refers to AA Gent, a Belgian soccer team not far from the studios.</li>
<li>In the Treasure Cave, there's a tombstone which reads: "The heart of all at Larian Studios go out to those who died or were bereft in such tragic circumstances in New York, Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania, on September 11th, 2001.</li>
<li>Many early forum regulars found their nicknames included in the game.</li>
<li>In Imp World, behind a flower patch, there's a note which reads: "Bronthion was here".</li>
<li>The game contains a short sword called "Sting". It glows near orcs and dragons, an obvious reference to <em>Lord of the Rings</em>.</li>
<li>The game has a magic carpet. To make it fly, you have to read the tag. It reads "Axeminster", the name of a carpet manufacturer in the United Kingdom.</li>
<li>In the Farmlands, there a scroll with a poem tribute to Stephen King's <em>IT</em>: "Your hair is winter fire, Aventuris embers, My heart dwells there too. - Written by IT."</li>
