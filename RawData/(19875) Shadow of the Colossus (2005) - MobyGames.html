    <p>In an ancient time long past, a young man travels to the ends of the Earth, a place that is said to be forbidden to enter. He carries a young woman, who died from a terrible curse. He seeks the Dormin, a strange and God-like being that resides there. The Dormin is surprised that the man carries an ancient and magical sword, and speaks to the man. The man pleas for his help in bringing back the woman's cursed soul, however the being says it is the law of mortals that a dead soul cannot be brought back. He does say though, that if the man is willing to accept some heavy consequences, that there might be a way to revive her. But it will not be easy. </p>
<p>The hero must embark on a quest to slay the sixteen colossi, giant creatures that tower hundreds of feet above the Earth. Using his ancient sword and his horse Agro, he must travel across the immense landscape seeking the colossi to save his love. Taking the form of various animals or bipedal human-like creatures, these colossi are tough and fierce. Their skin is tougher than leather, and the armor they wear is literally rock. However, by using his ancient sword, the man can penetrate the weak spot on them and destroy the towering beings and free his love's soul.</p>
<p><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> is set in the same universe as <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/5158/ico/">ICO</a>, and is a prequel to it. The entire game is dedicated to locating and fighting the sixteen colossi, which must be faced and defeated in a particular order. Finding the giant creatures is not always easy: the hero must mount his horse and ride through the world's vast landscapes, using his glowing sword as an indicator of the colossus' proximity. There are no enemies or hazards in the game world outside of the colossi battles. After a colossus has been found, a large-scale battle begins. Most of the colossi are huge, and much of the challenge in the battles lies in climbing on top of these creatures and staying there, while they are trying to shake the player character off. In a certain way the colossi function as hostile, moving platform stages.</p>
<p>The general goal in every battle is to reach the colossus' weakpoint and repeatedly stab it with the sword until he dies. Since the colossi vary greatly in shape, size, speed, intelligence, and attitude towards the hero, the player will have to adapt to different fighting styles and employ different tactics against them. Most of the battles involve extended platform action sequences, as the hero is trying to climb on the colossus and find its weak spot. Grabbing the creature's fur, timing the jumps, and getting in a good position to use the sword are often essential. Other tactics include fighting on horseback, using ranged attacks with the bow, luring the colossus into specific locations to use the environment against it, taking advantage of the terrain, etc. Environments in which battles take place are also varied, including mountains, deserts, lakes, ancient ruins, and others.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>Before I get started, let‚Äôs just consider this scenario.</p>
<blockquote>
‚ÄúOkay guys,I have this new idea! We‚Äôll make a game that‚Äôs entirely made out of boss fights!‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing else?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah! Just really awesome bosses!‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you just teleport from boss level to boss level and fight them?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! You have to ride to each boss for several minutes from the starting point first!‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, I see! Any enemies on the way there?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

‚ÄúObstacles then! Tough platform challenges?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs..... nice. Anyway, we‚Äôre doing sushi for lunch again?‚Äù
</blockquote>

<p>I can picture a similar scenario in a lesser studio, where the concept of Shadow Of The Colossus would have been shot down in a heartbeat. However, we‚Äôre talking the brainchild of Sony‚Äôs (ex) trump card, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/54313/fumito-ueda/">Fumito Ueda</a>, who came up with this very idea, and Team Ico went through with it.</p>
<p>And made one of the best games in video game history.</p>
<p>The premise itself is quickly told - you, the young hero, travel with your trusty horse to a place virtually at the end of the Earth, trying to appease the divine forces there to resurrect the girl you love.</p>
<p>You are given a chance to win her life back by defeating 16 colossi. And thus begins your adventure.</p>
<p>Following the light reflected off your sword, you head in a direction in the vast barren land until you encounter the next colossus to battle. The actual fight typically involves climbing up the body of the huge colossus, finding a weak spot and plunging your sword into it until the monster is dead.</p>
<p>This is not easy, given that you can only climb on the furry parts of the beast, that you can only hold on for a certain duration, and given that these giants thrash about like crazy when you start getting on their nerves, forcing you to hold on to your dear life.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs go to those colossi - they are the substance of the game, and they are fantastic. Each one is very distinct in look and behavior, each one requires a different approach. The game will give you just enough clues to figure out what to do without being too easy or too cryptic. Most of them are absolutely huge and intimidating, with the camera placed strategically to emphasize their dimensions.</p>
<p>Paired with that is absolutely gorgeous and atmospheric music, great particle effects and visuals. Every single battle is nothing short of epic, and I mean that in the classic sense of the word.</p>
<p>Even the rides to the bosses I made fun of in my intro are great. While they might appear a bit hollow, gameplay-wise, they‚Äôre fantastic to set the scene. You get to experience the vast landscape with swamps, mountains, and sheer drops that appear almost endless. They are complemented by a fantastic soundscape - loud winds in the canyons, roaring waterfalls, and the rustling of leaves in the forest. The graphics themselves have a minimalistic sense to them, as you would expect from Ueda, but they‚Äôre by no means ugly. While simple in geometry, they are nonetheless enormous - the plains are spacious in side, the mountains are tall, the dangerous cliffs span miles.</p>
<p>The story, while simple, has a fascinating twist to it that slowly unfolds as you progress. There is no sense of repetition, every fight presents you with a new area, a new nemesis, and a new strategy that you need to find. I don‚Äôt want to go into the resolution of the narrative, but it works out great.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>There‚Äôs really not much that I didn‚Äôt like about the game. At best, I can find some trifles to nitpick about. And just to keep this section wordy, I will.</p>
<p>The controls can be a bit tricky sometimes. One of the silliest exercises is trying to mount your horse - you‚Äôll usually spend some time hopping up and down next to your horse while it looks at you with confusion.</p>
<p>This is more of an issue in the short platform sections right before you get to a boss, the worst one being a long ascending walkway over a big lake that forces you to make two jumps at the top, which you‚Äôre likely to miss... causing you to plummet down into the water, where you have to slowly swim back to the beginning of the walkway and try again. I think I ended up with some bite marks on my controller.</p>
<p>You think you‚Äôre clever and save the game at the top of said walkway? Nah, you can only save at the end of a boss, or at a few save locations sparsely scattered around the world.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll briefly mention the PS3 version - it‚Äôs definitely an improvement over the PS2 version, mostly in terms of framerate (the PS2 can get very laggy during boss fights, which is precisely when you don‚Äôt need it), although the graphics themselves haven‚Äôt been updated much. The textures could have really benefited from a higher resolution. Overall, you could say that the PS2 version is on the upper spectrum of the console‚Äôs capabilities, while the PS3 is on the lower end. If given a choice though, you should obviously go for the PS3 version.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Shadow of the Colossus is simply stunning. From the intro sequence down, it oozes atmosphere every second. It doesn‚Äôt waste time with gameplay fillers like mini-bosses or waves of enemies. Instead, it tells a story and delivers carefully tuned gameplay where it matters.</p>
<p>If there is any doubt as to whether games are art or not, this game should eliminate any possible doubt. It has everything you could possibly ask - fantastic atmosphere, great visuals, a film-like score, solid gameplay, and a touching story.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>One of the things that rubbed me up the right way in this game is the main character. Sir, "whatever the fuck his name was" is not your everyday knight that you see in most medieval themed games. He is not on some holy quest, he is not even trying to get by, he is just been a completely pathetic loser. The story goes that this lad's girl dies and he can't for the love of God get over it and move on. Instead he brings her to a forbidden land and makes a deal with a demon, he is to hunt down 16 gigantic monsters and kill them, corrupting his body and soul in the process and throwing away everything he's got. Even the player can likely tell that his quest is going to be fruitless, but he is such an emotional wreck that he doesn't care either way.</p>
<p>Before we get to the meat of this game I'd like to EXPAND on the forbidden land in question (u c what I did thar?). This place is gigantic and very well designed, it is almost completely untouched by civilization and consists entirely out of natural beauty (or pixels). There were waterfalls, mountains, endless deserts, lush forests and even an area that looked like The Shire from Lord of the Rings. The few buildings you do run into make for an interesting change and they are often nicely fit with the area you were in anyway.</p>
<p>The world is not the only aspect that looks rather beautiful though, the characters are nothing different. While you will mostly be looking at "what's his name", that's not really a problem at all because his design is very good. He doesn't wear overly excessive clothing, but he does just enough to rise above standard clothing. Just like with Fi from <i>Skyward Sword</i> I loved the way his clothes moved in the wind.</p>
<p>But who the hell plays this game to look at that loser, we are here for the true stars of this game: The colossi. The best thing about these monsters is that they are actually gigantic monstrosities, not like most other fantasy games where "huge" is about the size of a house. The colossi are hulking giants that, as you might have guessed from the title, look like walking castles in terms of size.</p>
<p>Fighting these creatures feels fittingly epic and is way better than most other games where you just keep firing arrows at something like this or go through some routine to hurt him. Some colossi do require you to stun them and all of them have scripted weak-spots, but you will have to climb your way to them, jumping from ledge to ledge and desperately clinging to their hair as they shake you around. The grip-bar that shows you how much longer you can cling to the monster is a great way to force you to take chances and act riskier than you normally would.</p>
<p>Logically these monsters also pose a huge challenge and you will want to avoid getting hit by them. Even the trembles send out by their footsteps are enough to take a bit of health away, but if they manage to hit you with their attacks they will likely kill you in one or two hits. This is one of the rare games where I was actually sweating while playing it, the last one been the latest <i>Zelda</i> game for less fair reasons.</p>
<p>One thing I can't thank the game enough for though is the fact that it automatically puts up a checkpoint for you whenever you start a boss-fight. There were also some neat optional save-points set up all over the land that could come in handy.</p>
<p>Finally, I should mentioned the soundtrack. It was actually hearing the final boss theme that sold this game to me and there was a lot more where that came from. Overall it's the boss themes that make up the best songs in this game and they always helped keeping me hyped for the next encounter.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>I am going to get hate-mail for this, but I just hated that damn horse. Agro, as it is apparently called is your companion for this adventure and also your mount. I really tried to like her, but while the story tries its best, it is just held back by how utterly and completely annoying the horse is during gameplay. I think everybody can agree that a mount is supposed to get you from A to B as fast as possible, but Agro has to be arsed every second you are on top of her, to go at a reasonable pace and the slightest bump in the road will make her stagger. You also need to kick her like five times before she even starts moving to begin with. I am sorry, but I simply can't feel sympathy for something that annoys me.</p>
<p>Something that kinda makes me sad is that the Forbidden Land is naturally rather empty and this means that there are no characters. Aside from you, your horse, the imprisoned demon and your girlfriend who is apparently immune to rotting, there are no characters anywhere. This means that there is nobody to interact with and interacting with characters is my favorite part of any video games as it helps flesh out the world and immerse me into the story.</p>
<p>The only negative review I could find on this game on Mobygames mentioned the voice-acting was horrible, but I am not quite sure if "voice-acting" can be actually named here. The reason for this is that I am not even sure what these people are supposed to be speaking, it just sounds like complete gibberish to me and I didn't blame The Sims for bad voice-acting either. The language does annoy me though because it's crap like this that makes this game awkward to play when friends are near, like a family member walking in on you watching Star Trek in the middle of some Alien conversation.</p>
<p>While I mentioned that I liked the grip-mechanics there is one problem with them that just annoyed me. I was told that in order to increase your grip you need to shoot arrows into lizards and while I found a lot of lizards, I was never sure if I was actually getting more grip from them, the bar never seemed to increase. This made it even more difficult for me when I walked into a lizard paradise with over eight of the buggers in the same five square meters of ground.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>I clocked a short five hours on this game and this was my first playthrough ever, but unlike say... Call of Duty this game actually feels that much longer. Shadow of the Colossus feels like a very rich experience whereas most games are long and stretched, this game is short and stuffed. Fighting the colossi is by far one of the most exciting things I have done in a game for a while and despite some flaws and a weak ending, I am really glad I played this game.</p>
<p>This game is not meant for the people who expect a game to be paced very fast, keeping you in the action at all times. Shadow of the Colossus takes its time to immerse you into the world and you will spend 70% of your time travelling instead. If you like immersive games than you owe it to yourself to check this one out. If you are a fan of platform games or you like the premise of killing colossi than you should be aware of the pacing and try this at your own risk.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>Even before starting Shadow of the Colossus, one might already have an inclination as to how beautiful, how epic, or how different this game will be. And after the introduction, one might have an even greater sense of what is to come. Yet, that one still has no idea.</p>
<p>It is nearly impossible to describe the feeling that springs forth upon seeing the first cinematic of the first Colossus lumbering about its portion of the expansive landscape. All that was expected, or imagined, is washed away to be filled with a... an uplifting awe. If it were not for the sublime, heavy task that, you, the hero(Wander) agrees to undertake, one might be content just admiring the impressiveness and beauty of the giant. However...</p>
<p>There is a battle to be had. You are not entirely alone in this struggle, as you have your most reliable steed, Agro, accompanying you into danger, but it is you alone who must scale and ultimately fell the Colossus. It knows you are there and perhaps even knows why you are there. It will not allow you to simply climb, find its point of weakness and drive your sword into its body. Crushing you beneath its feet, smashing you to bits, violently thrashing you about,
but you are triumphant. The Colossus is slain and there is satisfaction, albeit short-lived.</p>
<p>That is only one of 16. Each Colossus bringing a sense of wonderment. What will the next one look like? What is needed to be done to defeat it? Each defeat becoming less satisfying and possibly more sorrowful. One might wonder at the killing of these giants. The cinematics, the music all lending, and leading to a very heartfelt, soulful conclusion.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Much has been said about the camera being a nuisance at times, and slight graphical errors. All can EASILY be dismissed. 
There is one conscious disappointment for me. However, it will not be mentioned, for I fear it would turn you away from partaking in a tremendous experience. It did not do so for me, but it can be regarded as a bummer, and might do so for you.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Shadow of the Colossus is a game that could play a sweet, sweet melody on your heartstrings. If you prefer to experience a game, rather than just play it, Shadow certainly is one. If you prefer to play, let Shadow satisfy you.</p>

    <h3>1001 Video Games</h3>
<p>The PS2 version of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> appears in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Video_Games_You_Must_Play_Before_You_Die" rel="nofollow">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a> by General Editor Tony Mott.</p>
<h3>Character</h3>
<p>Throughout the game, the main character's appearance continually gets worse from the physical and mental strain of fighting the colossi and from the strain of the dark spirits possessing him. His hair and clothes will gradually get dirtier, and his clothes will eventually tear in numerous places. Also, his face will scar and get paler as the game continues. </p>
<h3>Demake</h3>
<p>In September 2008 the game was "demade" for the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/8450/tigsource-bootleg-demakes-competition/">TIGSource Bootleg Demakes competition</a> as <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/39174/hold-me-closer-giant-dancer/">Hold me closer, Giant Dancer</a>.</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> is known for pushing the PS2 hardware to its limits. For example, SotC features fake HDR (High Dynamic Range) rendering, even though the PS2 hardware doesn't really support HDR.</p>
<p>Another example for this is the the "fur shader" - the colossi are very hairy and are the fur is rendered quite convincingly. The fur also features some simulated anisotropic lighting, giving the fur realistic highlights. Again, the common way to achieve this is not possible on the PS2, but the game developers managed to approximate this.</p>
<p>The game features many other technological achievements. Some are visible such as self-shadowing, and some are behind the scenes, such as the complex memory management system that allows for the huge game world without loading time or memory fragmentation.</p>
<p>Further details can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bx96LuRBo4jASGNmVHNaUjZRU2VDb18weV9MLXktUQ/edit" rel="nofollow">The Making of "Shadow of the Colossus"</a> (5 MB pdf), which includes explanations from the game's developers, and in an <a href="http://www.gameanim.com/2007/09/18/shedding-light-on-the-shadow/" rel="nofollow">analysis</a> by <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Jonathan+Cooper">Jonathan Cooper</a></p>
<h3>Extras</h3>
<p>The PAL release comes in a cardboard packaging containing four unique postcards with art work depicting moments from the game. It also includes camera interviews with artistic partners and creative directors <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/54313/fumito-ueda/">Fumito Ueda</a> and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Kenjj+Kaido">Kenjj Kaido</a> to get a look behind the scenes, an image gallery with concept sketches and in-game stills, and the original game trailer to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/5158/ico/">ICO</a>.</p>
<h3>References</h3>
<p>Various philosophical elements are present in the game. For instance, Dormin is reminiscent of the biblical character Nimrod. Nimrod is a biblical king credited for the creation of the Tower of Babel, whose purpose was to build a stairway into the heavens. Before its completion, the builders tongues are mixed up into different languages (which, according to the Bible, justifies the many languages of the Earth). As well, the Tower of Babel is said to be one of the tallest structures on the Earth, and could be seen from all parts of the Earth.</p>
<p>The shrine of worship is completely symbolic of the Tower of Babel. Dormin is meant to represent Nimrod, the builder of the shrine, and if one notices closely, Dormin is an exact anagram of Nimrod. As well, through a secret method the character is able to climb the tower and reach a paradise, symbolic of a Heaven or other after-life paradise (notice that in the story, Mono and Wander are only able to climb to the top of the tower once they are free of Dormin, who represents Sin and evil). The tower is obviously the hugest structure on the map, and can be seen from all parts of the map (if the view is not obstructed) As well, before Dormin can ascend to total power (as if ascending into Heaven), he is split up into 16 parts, thus completing the image of the builders being divided by their changed languages.</p>
<h3>References to the game</h3>

<li>The basic premise of this game (enormous monsters with light-up self-destruct buttons) is riffed on in a <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/10/21" rel="nofollow">Penny Arcade webcomic strip</a> dated October 21st, 2005.</li>
<li><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> is referenced in the movie <em>Reign over Me</em> (2007) where actor Adam Sandler is addicted to it.</li>
