    <p>Normally a solar eclipse isn't a dangerous event, but for Soma Cruz, being sucked through a portal and into Dracula's castle during one will turn his day into a total nightmare. As Soma, you must venture through the castle and find a way out. As you do so, you will discover the true meaning behind the event, and why Dracula has risen yet again.</p>
<p>Although set in the future, all of the weapons and hazards are the same or similar to those seen in past <em>Castlevania</em> titles. Soma can find or buy weapons of all types such as swords, spears, and axes. Through his mysterious power of Dominance Soma can take the souls of his enemies and use their powers as his own, providing passive stat boosts, powerful magic, or even summoning them forth to fight on his behalf. Dracula's castle is a single continuous building, and as Soma's power of Dominance grows and he acquires more monster souls to power abilities he can bypass obstacles that were previously insurmountable. Players can link up with a friend's copy of <em>Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</em> to trade souls between them.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>There's always a way. If you're not good with buttons, just kill some enemies, level up a bit, and make some money in order to purchase potions and items. Eventually you'll be strong enough to defeat whatever that seems to block you. In Super Metroid you may have learnt to avoid enemies as much as possible, here you'll want to kill them all, since with every enemy you kill, you gain experience points and become stronger.</p>
<p>If you set out to achieve 100% collection rate, you'll likely only want to kill enemies that you have not yet collected. So you will want to leave and enter rooms repeatedly to kill the same enemies over and over, while ignoring other enemies. There are very few things in life that hit a man harder than this feeling, this desire, to collect an enemy's soul. Aria of Sorrow provides this feeling.</p>
<p>Cool characters. Soma looks like Sephiroth, and the girl Mina is his childhood best friend and she's attractive. You play as Soma, so that's an immediate motivation to start playing (assuming you're a guy).</p>
<p>The environments are full of symbolism. Paintings and sculptures of angels, demons, and all those religion and prophecy stuff.</p>
<p>The whole "gain new powers to unlock new areas" thing is delightfully similar to Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night. You can only jump this high at first, so there will be rooms that are out of reach. In later stages, you gain an incredibly awesome ability that shoots you straight up towards the ceiling. This is by far the coolest move in any platform game ever, that even outshines Super Metroid's Shinespark. You're no longer walking or running through rooms, you'll be jumping around in rooms. You're always jumping, it's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Most of the time the path is clear and you'll know where to go next. You won't feel frustration with this game. You're always leveling up and collecting stuff. Satisfaction is ALWAYS there in your heart and soul.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Some weapons and armors are useless (If you have played Diablo 2, this is like picking up a level 2 leather jacket when you're at level 30.) For example you'll see a sword quite early in the game, but won't be able to acquire it until much, much later. You'll naturally want that sword to be worth the wait, since you'll move through that room frequently, and everytime you enter that room, you see that sword, and wonder "when am I going to be able to get THERE? What ability is required for it? What special attribute does this sword have?" But by the time you get the sword, you already have a weapon that's better in every aspect. You'll want to sell this lame, newly acquired sword for money, in order to buy the Soul Eater Ring.</p>
<p>But seriously, this isn't even nitpicking. It's less than a nitpick. There isn't anything in Aria of Sorrow that I don't like.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>100% soul collection rate may seem hard at first. After the main quest is completed, you'll probably be at only 20% or less. You'll wonder how long 100% takes. Actually, the process doesn't feel long, because it's filled with satisfaction.  Everytime you collect a soul, it becomes a new spell that you can cast, but I don't even care about that very much. I collect it because I wanna collect it, not because I wanna use the spell. Every time you add 1% to the grand total, you're like "OH YEAH" "THAT's what I'm talking about". You'll want to dance. So, basically, Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow invites you to dance, to celebrate 80 joyful moments in your life.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>Where do I start? Okay, a bit of the story... </p>
<p>It's the year 2035. A transfer student by the name of Soma Cruz and his childhood friend Mina Hakuba are, during a solar eclipse, on their way to the Hakuba shrine. Something weird happens; they are drawn into the eclipse, and end up at a mysterious castle, where they meet a man by the name of Genya Arikado (straight-forward, eh?). Genya informs them that the castle they just arrived in is that of Dracula, a vicious vampire who has been the target of several vampire hunters for centuries. Some moments later, a group of monsters appear, and Genya manages to fend them off -- but one of their souls were pulled into Soma, as if by some magnetic force. As explained by Genya, this is the awakening of Soma's "power of dominance", an ability to collect souls in order to gain abilities (essentially permanent power-ups). And that's where our adventure begins. I don't want to spoil anything, so let's move on to gameplay mechanics and the like, shall we? I do want to add that it has some interesting twists, and it's worth playing through to have the whole story unfold in front of you.</p>
<p>This game has the classic "Castlevania adventure"-type gameplay, as pioneered by Castlevania II: Simon's Quest, and mastered by Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (which apparently will remain the mold for future Castlevania titles). What can I say? I love this type of gameplay. Sidescrolling action-adventure is absolutely awesome, and with the ability to level up, all the customization abilities (souls, equipment, weapons), yeah... It's one of the most complete games I've played. Totally my thing. Have you not played previous Castlevania titles like this, or perhaps not even the Metroid games, then the basic gameplay is as follows: you are limited to a certain area of the castle until you find a new ability to jump higher (and reach high platforms), slide, walk on water, walk under water... or perhaps until you simply find a key. The feeling you get is ever as rewarding, and it motivates you to keep on playing. However, the downside is, of course, that you can hit walls several times throughout your playthrough. I know I did. I know I stopped playing the game for weeks multiple times, before deciding to pick it up again and get past a certain part. (I was unaware of guides, it seems.)</p>
<p>One of the game's biggest features are the souls, which I mentioned earlier (when I talked about customization). The game is more or less centered around this system, and it's, as mentioned earlier, closely tied-in with the story. It adds quite a lot of depth. Here's how it works: When you kill an enemy, you have a chance of obtaining its soul. These souls are equippable. There are 3 different soul types, and you can have one of each equipped at the same time; yellow, blue, and red. The yellow types are sort of passive abilities (always activate, drains no MP), like walking on water, increasing stats, getting stronger when poisoned, etc. The blue type of souls are like skills. They drain a certain amount of MP, and they do things like letting you fly, glide, create a barrier, summon an imp (!) which follows you around and protects you against enemies, etc. The red type is an attack variant. Have you played any of the early Castlevania games? Remember how you had things like axes and crosses, which you consumed hearts to use? Well, it's a bit like that, only these drain MP instead of hearts... and they're permanent, of course. Some souls even let you temporarily transform, which is cool. As I also mentioned, you have armor and weapons, like you do in any RPG. And it works pretty much the same as in all of those games... The types of equipment are divided into Hand, Body, and Accessory; Hand is obviously for weapons, Body is for armor, and Accessory is for... accessories. All do various changes to stats. Some weapons do more damage to certain enemy types, some accessories give you more resistance against magic or elements or so. As you would expect... Nevertheless, there's hundreds of different equipments, hundreds of different souls. There's plenty of depth here... especially considering it's a Castlevania game. :) There's also the Abilities, as they are so simply called. These add zero depth, however. Most only allow you to progress in the game, like the double jump Ability.</p>
<p>The boss battles are also amazing, but can occasionally get frustrating. Although, here's the thing; the game has RPG elements (to the point where it has leveling up, at least), so grinding does wonders. If not that, buy some potions... ;) The music is wonderful, and the soundtrack includes several catchy tunes. It's hard to explain how music sounds, though, so think I'll leave that to you... But in a nutshell, it's typical Castlevania-ish; sort of a midi symphony thing. And it's awesome. Sound effects aren't bad, either. As for the graphics, they are far, far better than those of Circle of the Moon, and they look a bit more realistic (as if that's important) than the graphics in Harmony of Icantspellitsname. They are what they need to be. They fit perfectly. Not cheap, not half-arsed. Just perfect. Like previous Castlevania titles of the same "type", this one also has a comprehensive... lexicon of enemies. You can display weaknesses, you can, obviously, look at the enemies. It lists their levels, etc...the stats you need to know. That is, provided you have battled them once already. As for characters, the game doesn't really include many, but they're all interesting. I really like the game's protagonist, Soma Cruz (even though he's a bit "emo"). Very memorable.</p>
<p>Hm, I guess I've covered most of it already, hm? Oh! You can actually get GUNS in this one. That encourages exploration. Farming lead is awesome, and you know it.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>Other than the fact that I probably tried beating the last boss like 20 times before I finally got him, which got really frustrating to say the least (I solved the issue by buying potions. Heh.), I didn't REALLY dislike anything about this game. However, there were a few things I could do without.</p>
<p>One of the lines before the last boss were cheesy as hell. Another thing that I feel I need to address, is that this one lacks one of the neat features of the last installment (Harmony of Icantspellitsname); that one decorable room, which encourages the player to explore more than they already had to find more decorations, like chairs and statues. But that's not a huge problem, exactly.</p>
<p>It's also pretty short. I finished it in about 10 hours, though it felt like longer. Well, it probably WAS longer. I often did die and had to replay parts (especially bosses)... Still, one can surely finish it in one sitting, provided you know what to do. Definitely. <br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow is a wonderful title, more-than-worthy of the Castlevania name. It's the best of the series, in my opinion, counting games before and after it (that I have played). A real gem. I can't really say a single bad thing about it. It's near-perfection, and my fascination hasn't worn off since I got it like 3-4 years ago (even if I, admittedly, do not play it often).</p>
<p>The fact that I got this and Harmony of Icantspellitsname (Castlevania Double Pack) for about 30 bucks was, to say the least, a real bargain. I had no idea such an epic adventure would await me. And I still have yet to beat Harmony of Dissonance (I could spell it, after all).</p>
<p>This also marks my longest review ever written. That alone should show how much I love this game.</p>
<p>If you get a chance of getting it, do not hesitate! It's a very fun game and might just have the most depth of any Castlevania game to date.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>I haven't played any Castlevania games that came out after Super Castlevania IV, so I really didn't know how they were at all. I found a used copy of Castlevania : Aria of Sorrow, and a friend told me that it was very good, so I picked it up.
I was quite surprised that this game is really not much like Castlevania games I've played on the NES and Super NES, except that's it's a platformer and that it's a very good game.</p>
<p>The gameplay of this game is fantastic. You can level up and equip different weapons like you can in action RPGs, effectively making this game an platformer-RPG. I've tried many platformer-RPG games on the NES, including <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/7331/faxanadu/">Faxanadu</a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Zelda+2">Zelda II : The Adventure of Link</a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/9860/the-battle-of-olympus/">The Battle of Olympus</a>, and of course <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Simon's+Quest">Castlevania II : Simon's Quest</a>. However all of them make me feel lost after 5-10 minutes of gameplay and as following a walkthrough isn't really fun, I've assumed the platformer-RPG genre was just not a good formula. Fortunately, Castlevania : Aria of Sorrow proved me the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Controls are easy and responsive, playing this game is just as fun as playing any other platformer (as opposed to games mentioned above). You can equip weapons with different response speed and range, allowing you a wide range of strategy against you opponents. Is it better to equip a slow weapon but that is powerful or to equip a weaker and more short-ranger, but much faster weapon ?
Also, each enemy in the game has a low probability to release a soul when defeated. You are then able to equip 3 different kind of souls,  attack, support and "implicit" souls at a time. Collecting them will allow you to use enemie's attack against other enemies, which is cool, and allow you to perform a very wide range of various moves. In order to progress the story, you must find special abilities which will for example allow you to jump higher in order to access new areas, etc...</p>
<p>You take the control of a guy named Soma Cruz that is the weirdest hero ever. He looks like a girl, have a weird name and looks more like a bad guy than a hero. Although he's the protagonist of this game, he's not a Belmont clan guy by the way. The game happens in September 2035 and you are teleported in the inside of a solar eclipse (in fact a solar eclipse is actually predicted in Japan for that date), inside the castle of Dracula (don't ask me what it does inside of an eclipse). You only goal is to exit. Of course there isn't a story as developed as in true RPGs, but it's definitely a decently developed story for a platformer.</p>
<p>The graphics of the game are really among the best I've seen on the GBA. Sprites are very detailed and animated, you can see the cape of the main character flowing into the wind. There is a lot of transparency effects, and background is very detailed. It basically proof that 2D doesn't mean outdated graphics.</p>
<p>The music of the game is excellent and varied, sometimes upbeat/fast-paced and sometimes slow and melancholic. Each level have a music that suits it well. Unlike the majority of GBA games, sound effects are very well done as well. You get some voice acting (in Japanese) from enemies and you can really hear the bones of your enemies falling apart when you defeat them. The protagonist also randomly hurls when attacking which sounds great. It's one of the rare GBA games that made full use of the sound hardware.</p>
<p>Finally the difficulty is just right, the game really isn't hard but when entering a new harder area you'll probably loose a couple of times before finding the first save point where you can recover. After that you can just level up if you have trouble, so the game isn't really hard, but it's not too easy either. You can carry healing items and use them during boss fight if you want, but sometimes you'll be saying "I'll retry to beat that boss this time conserving healing items for when I'll really need them".
You can unlock an "oldscool mode" where you play as another protagonist which this time have the classical whip, cross, axe and holy water as weapons, and where you get rid of the story scenes and RPG elements of the game (levels, items, etc...). You still don't have the crappy jump control of NES Castlevania games, fortunately.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>The only thing I can possibly think is that the game is a bit short. After beating the game normally you can unlock new modes, but still beating the whole game in all modes adds up to 12-15 hours in total even if you level up a lot and try to discover each tiny corner of the game, which is quite short by modern standards.
<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>This game has excellent gameplay, graphics and sound, and proves that the platformer-RPG genre isn't doomed to crap anymore. While a lot different from Castlevania games I've played on my old Nintendo consoles, it's still just as good as it was. <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6619/super-castlevania-iv/">Super Castlevania IV</a> is still my favourite of the series tough. So if you have been playing classic Castlevania games and are curious to play a modern Castlevania game for your little GBA you're looking to the right place. If you have missed the classic games of course I still recommend to play this, but you're still missing something.</p>
