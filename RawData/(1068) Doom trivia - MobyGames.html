  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <div class="shrink-headings text-break-word"><h3>1001 Video Games</h3>
<p><i>Doom</i> appears in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Video_Games_You_Must_Play_Before_You_Die" rel="nofollow">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a> by General Editor Tony Mott.</p>
<h3>3DO version</h3>
<p>The development of the 3DO port was rushed; it was developed in ten weeks, from August to October of 1995. The 3DO release contains exclusive, CD-quality remixes of the PC's background music. According to the programmer, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/343/rebecca-ann-heineman/">Rebecca Ann Heineman</a>, hiring a band to record the music was necessary because she had no time to port the original game's music driver. </p>
<p>The 3DO version was originally planned to contain FMV cutscenes; Art Data Interactive created a number of still images (depicting actors in monster costumes) in hopes of convincing investors into giving them funds to film the sequences, but ultimately none were created. </p>
<p>The game was originally going to be distributed by <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Electronic+Arts">Electronic Arts</a>, but the deal fell through. </p>
<p>The source code of this port was <a href="https://github.com/Olde-Skuul/doom3do" rel="nofollow">released on GitHub</a> by Rebecca Ann Heineman on November 30, 2014. </p>
<h3>Administrator tool</h3>
<p><i>DOOM</i> was proposed for use as a tool for systems administrators in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Dennis+Chow">Dennis Chow</a>'s paper <a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~dlchao/flake/doom/chi/chi.html" rel="nofollow">Doom as an Interface for Process Management</a>; in it, through a modified version of DOOM (PSDoom or the Doom Process Manager), processes are depicted as enemies whose share of systems resources can be diminished by attacking them and which are completely terminated when their avatars are killed.  (On a loaded system in which all programs' performances are strained, processes may begin attacking each other, aggressively competing - as in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/107311/core-war/">Core War</a> - for system resources).</p>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<ul><li>When the player picks up a medikit while having 25 HP or less, the game is supposed to display the message "Picked up a medikit you REALLY need!" Due to a bug this message will never display in vanilla <i>DOOM</i>. The code in question does its check on how much health is left only after the medikit is picked up. Since medikits give the player 25 health, they will always have at least 26 health when the check is performed. This bug is corrected in most <i>DOOM</i> source ports.</li>
<li>The 1.0 release had a bug that slowed down networks so much that a freeware utility called <i>killdoom</i> was released shortly after. It can be downloaded <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/utils/network/killdoom" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li></ul>
<h3>Cheats</h3>
<p>The &lt;tt&gt;SPISPOPD&lt;/tt&gt; cheat code (no clipping) stands for "Smashing Pumpkins Into Small Piles Of Putrid Debris". It has nothing to do with the band - rather, it's a reference to an Usenet post joking about a possible alternate title for <i>Doom</i>. More detail can be found <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/SPISPOPD" rel="nofollow">at the Doom Wiki</a>. </p>
<h3>Demo scene</h3>
<p>It was the first game to make a head-first mention in a demo (a 64k intro: Cyboman by Gazebo) a couple of days after <i>DOOM</i> was spread. The uptight demo-scene back then actually accepted the game, especially for its amazing graphics and execution. Until that time, most demosceners considered games to be far behind demos in terms of technology.</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<ul><li>Data file extension WAD means "Where's All the Data?"</li>
<li><moby developer="American McGee">American McGee</moby> used actual ground beef for some of the textures in the game.  A trick that worked so well that he re-used it in <moby game="American McGee&#39;s Alice">American McGee's Alice</moby>.</li>
<li>In a little known FTP strategy guide bundled with some BBS versions of <i>DOOM</i>, <moby developer="John Carmack">John Carmack</moby> is quoted as saying "<i>DOOM</i> is in development for the Sega Mars". The Sega Mars was in fact the codename for the Sega 32X.</li>
<li>Alpha and beta versions are available through <a href="http://ftp.cdrom.com" rel="nofollow">ftp.cdrom.com</a> in the pub/doom/history directory. Most are crude technology demos, but there are some treasures.</li>
<li>The sky background of Episode 1 was taken from a photograph of Yangshuo Cavern made by Tom Atwood.</li></ul>
<h3>Doomguy</h3>
<p>Although on the box cover of the game the Doomguy carries a weapon in his right hand, in the game, he is left handed - from the first person view, he carries his weapon in his left hand and also punches with his left fist. The hands of the Doomguy, which millions of players believed to belong to themselves, actually are <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/820/kevin-cloud/">Kevin Cloud</a>'s - one of the art developers. In the very early stages of <i>DOOM</i> the DoomGuy's right ear could take damage and turn into flimsy peace of flesh. This was removed in the later versions of <i>DOOM</i>.</p>
<h3>Enemies</h3>
<ul>
<li>The design of the monster <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/File:Cacodemon_encounter.png" rel="nofollow">Cacodemon</a> (a floating head with a large maw and a single big eye) is very similar to the <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/c/c3/Beholde1.gif/revision/latest?cb=20220113064227" rel="nofollow">beholder</a>, a classic <moby gamegroup="D&amp;D / AD&amp;D licensees">AD&amp;D</moby> monster (although the cacodemon has horns instead of eye stalks). Additionally, the Cacodemon's design is almost identical to the head of the "astral dreadnought", an AD&amp;D monster which appears on <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/File:Beholdercaco.jpg" rel="nofollow">the cover</a> of the 1987 AD&amp;D book <i>Manual of the Planes</i>.</li>
<li>Although the death animations of some monsters (Cacodemon, Baron of Hell) show that their blood is blue or green, these monsters always emit red blood splatters when damaged.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Eric Harris Levels</h3>
<p>Columbine High School shooter Eric Harris is known to have created several levels for the game. A few including Thrasher.wad and RealDeth.wad have resurfaced, but a rumoured recreation in the game of the Columbine High School itself (possibly called Realdoom.wad), which would provide a macabre fascination, has yet to be found</p>
<h3>Fake Atari 2600 Port</h3>
<p>Many people thought there was an Atari 2600 port of <i>DOOM</i> in development when images of the port started spreading around the Internet, including pictures of the cartridge, a magazine ad and screenshots from the game. These turned out to be the results of a college project rendered on an Atari 800 computer by James Catalano, who for a joke posted them on a Usenet newsgroup.</p>
<h3>GBA version</h3>
<p>The Game Boy Advance port features green blood and removed splatter effects. Additionally corpses disappear almost instantly and all corpses which were used as part of the level decoration were removed.</p>
<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p><i>DOOM</i> had a low-res mode (toggled via F5) that doubled the width of the pixels being plotted by messing with the write mask in unchained VGA mode. That, coupled with the triple-buffering used, made the game majorly fast and quite playable on a 386/40. Carmack was experimenting with a Hi-Color mode that allowed more than 256 colors on the screen, but that mode halved resolution. He wanted to see what it would look like because it got rid of the color-banding due to the diminished lighting, but 160-pixels horizontally looked very bad so they removed it. Up to version 1.1, it was possible to run the game on three monitors at once, giving a 270-degree field of vision.</p>
<h3>Multiplayer</h3>
<p><i>DOOM</i> was the first game to include a deathmatch mode, in which up to four players can compete over a network or in split screen. Maps used for deathmatch were the single-player levels, made less linear.
In December 1993, Intel issued a company-wide memo banning <i>DOOM</i> from their networks. Many big companies issued similar orders, not just because of lost productivity but because it rendered most networks inoperative. Up until version 1.2, the game sent data through high-level broadcast packets that forced every computer on a net (no matter whether they were running the game or not) to transfer the data.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Much of the music in <i>DOOM</i> (and <i>DOOM II</i>) is likely to be inspired by songs of famous heavy metal bands. For example, the music from E1M1 is similar to Metallica's <i>No Remorse</i> (some also say that it is very similar to <i>Master of Puppets</i>), that in E1M4 resembles <i>Rise</i> by Pantera, and the music from E2M1 is similar to AC/DC's <i>Big Gun</i>.</p>
<h3>Novels</h3>
<p>Dafydd Ab Hugh and Brad Linaweaver wrote a set of four novels about the <i>DOOM</i> universe. They were published between June 1995 and January 1996 by Pocket Books. You can view the covers on <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/ducksoup/393/brad.htm" rel="nofollow">this fanpage</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Knee Deep in the Dead</i></li>
<li><i>Hell on Earth</i></li>
<li><i>Infernal Sky</i></li>
<li><i>Endgame</i></li>
</ul>
<p>In May 1996, Tom Grindberg of Marvel Comics made a comic book about <i>DOOM</i> for a gaming convention.</p>
<h3>References</h3>
<ul><li>John Carmack took the title from the 1986 Martin Scorsese film <i>The Color of Money</i>, from the lines when <moby developer="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</moby> enters a pool hall with his favorite cue in a black case:<br>
- "What you got in there?"<br> 
"In here? Doom."</li>
<li><i>DOOM</i>'s cover art, title screen, and chainsaw weapon seem to be inspired by the <i>Evil Dead</i> series of movies, specifically <i>Army of Darkness</i>. In the movie's storyline, the main character loses his hand to evil powers and fights with a chainsaw on his arm, along with a shotgun. It would be the later 3D game <moby game="Duke Nukem 3D" platform="DOS">Duke Nukem 3D</moby>, itself influenced by <i>DOOM</i>, that would quote some of <i>Evil Dead</i>'s most memorable one-liners. </li>
<li>The layout of E1M8 (Phobos Anomaly) bears resemblance to Liberty Island in New York, although it is not clear whether this is intentional.</li>
<li>The name of the last level of episode 2, "Tower of Babel", is an ironic Biblical reference. It is described in Genesis 11:1-9 as a physical pathway to the Heavens. In <i>DOOM</i>, however, the level is the pathway to Hell, as explained in the episode's ending text. On a side note, during that episode, the tower can be seen being built on the intermission screens.</li>
<li>The name of the fourth skill level, "Ultra-Violence", very likely comes from Anthony Burgess' novel <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> or its film adaptation by <moby developer="Stanley Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</moby>. In the novel and film, the protagonist uses the term to describe the activities of himself and his gang - randomly beating up, raping and killing people.</li>
<li>The first retail version-only update of the <i>DOOM</i> engine had the revision number 1.666. This is also a Biblical reference, where 666 is the number of The Beast.</li></ul>
<h3>References in pop culture</h3>
<ul><li>Rammstein used a sample of the <i>DOOM</i> shotgun and some screaming in their song <i>Wollt ihr das Bett in Flammen sehen?</i> on their album <i>Herzeleid</i>. </li>
<li>The credits inside the booklet of The Smashing Pumpkins' album <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</i> (1995) contain "Explosion from DOOM courtesy of id Software, Inc and bobby prince Music". It's used in the first track, <i>Where Boys Fear to Tread</i>.</li>
<li>The game makes an appearance in season 5, episode 4 of <i>Family Guy</i>, an animated series. Stevie Griffin is riding his bike through various locations, and one of them is a <i>DOOM</i> level with some imps.</li>
<li>In season 2, episode 8, Ross must choose between Rachel and Julie and starts making a list of pros and cons of each. Joey and Chandler are helping him, and Chandler is making the list on his brand new laptop with "Twelve megabytes of RAM, 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 BPS". While they're making the list, Ross says that Julie is a paleontologist just like him, while Rachel is just a waitress. To that, Chandler replies: "Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? [looks to Ross and Joey, who stare back] Or we could keep doing this. What else?"</li>
<li><i>DOOM</i> was parodied in an episode of "Die Redaktion" (The Editorial Team), a monthly comedy video produced by the German gaming magazine GameStar. It was published on the DVD of issue 12/2011.</li></ul>
<h3>Rocket jumping</h3>
<p><i>DOOM</i> was the first game to include rocket jumping. Only, it worked a bit different from later first person shooters - instead of aiming at the ground (which you couldn't do in the game), you shoot a rocket launcher at a nearby object or wall. The resulting blast can proper the player a quite long distance away, allowing to clear otherwise impossible jumps.</p>
<h3>Scrapped Features</h3>
<ul><li>The game was originally going to feature a story-based seamless world, similar to <moby game="Half-Life">Half-Life</moby>. However, everyone hated <moby developer="Tom Hall">Tom Hall</moby>'s story idea (soldiers playing cards? Come on!) and Carmack decided the engine couldn't handle a seamless world.</li>
<li>John Carmack once said that he fully intended to add decal support in <i>DOOM</i> (e.g. semi-permanent marks on the walls from bullets, explosions, blood. etc.). It was not implemented, however, since it would raise the game's system requirements.</li></ul>
<h3>SEGA 32x version</h3>
<p>This version contains only seventeen maps, taken from the "Knee Deep in the Dead" and "The Shores of Hell" episodes. No maps from the third episode, "Inferno", have been included. Maps present: E1M1-E1M8 and E2M1-E2M7, as well as the two secret levels E1M9 and E2M9 (E2M9, renamed to "Dis", acts as the final level of the game). After the end credits, the game concludes by reverting to a fake DOS prompt if the player activated the cheat codes. This screen cannot be exited without shutting off the system. If the game was beaten without cheating, the prompt will not be shown; rather the player will see a montage of enemies encountered in the game, just as in <i>DOOM II</i>.</p>
<h3>SNES version</h3>
<p>The U.S. SNES version of <i>DOOM</i> was one of the few releases for the console to have a colored cartridge (<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/4287/killer-instinct/">Killer Instinct</a> being another one), namely a red one.  Besides this, due to limitations of the SNES hardware, the enemies in the game do not have sides or backs, and are always facing the player. All blood and splatter effects were removed.</p>
<p>The source code of this port was <a href="https://github.com/RandalLinden/DOOM-FX" rel="nofollow">released on GitHub</a> by <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=%0ARandy+Linden">Randy Linden</a> on July 14, 2020.</p>
<h3>Source code</h3>
<p>On 23 December, 1997, id Software released the source code. You can <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/source/doomsrc" rel="nofollow">download 
it here</a>. Numerous source ports were subsequently created by fans. </p>
<h3>Text adventure</h3>
<p>In 1996, the first level of the first episode was implemented by Piers Johnson in TADS, resulting in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/129662/foom/">FooM</a> - a text adventure game interface for <i>DOOM</i>. Downloadable with source at <a href="http://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/tads/foom.tar.gz" rel="nofollow">http://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/tads/foom.tar.gz</a></p>
<h3>Version 1.4</h3>
<p>With patch 1.4, including all later re-releases and ports, a detail in the "Command Cotrol" level was changed: a few computers laid out into the shape of a swastika were rearranged. Romero referred to this change in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUU7_BthBWM" rel="nofollow">2013 interview</a>: </p>
<blockquote>[43:11] It was a swastika, but [...] I changed it to this shape because we had people complainin' and really the funny thing is that I wasn't trying to promote Nazism, I was referencing <moby game="Wolfenstein 3D">Wolfenstein</moby>. [...] [44:21] And we got lots of people, you know, crying over different things about the game, but that was the only thing that we changed. Just because, I think we got a particular, like, letter from someone who was a vet. And so, well, okay, for a vet, we'll do that.</blockquote>
<h3>Weapons</h3>
<ul><li>The images for the pistol in <i>DOOM</i> were most likely created from the Beretta 92FS pistol, which is currently the standard service pistol of the U.S. military.</li>
<li>The pistol, shotgun, and chaingun where photos of toy guns, while the chainsaw was the photo of a real chainsaw. It belonged to the girlfriend of one of the art developers, Tom Hall.</li></ul>
<h3>Windows 95 Promo</h3>
<p>The level E1M2: Nuclear Plant was used for <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Bill+Gates">Bill Gates</a>' promo for Windows 95.</p>
