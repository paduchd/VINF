    <p>Caleb was once a feared gunslinger, until he met a woman who was involved with a mysterious cult known as Cabal. Caleb, too, is sucked in, and soon becomes one of the Chosen - the most favored worshippers of the evil god Tchernobog. But one day, Tchernobog inexplicably kills the four Chosen, including Caleb. Mysteriously resurrected years later, Caleb is out to get revenge, and learn why his lord cast him down so abruptly.</p>
<p><em>Blood</em> is a first-person shooter with horror elements, which uses the Build engine. Similarly to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Duke+Nukem+3D">Duke Nukem 3D</a>, the environment is interactive: many objects can be physically moved or affected in other ways. Destruction of landscapes is possible (although only in specific spots), with bullet holes being left by misplaced shots. The Build engine version is 2.5D, so there are rooms above rooms and puzzles which are based on this.</p>
<p>The game consists of four episodes, each containing a set of maps that have to be traversed by the protagonist in a specific order. The levels are usually realistic-looking structures, e.g. a carnival complete with twisted attractions, a city district, a moving train, etc.</p>
<p>Throughout the levels, Caleb will have to find keys (up to six in a level) and hit switches in order to work his way to the exit. On the way, he will meet a variety of enemies, such as zombies that tend to come back to life after killed, cultists armed with shotguns and tommy guns that shout in pseudo-Latin language, crawling hands that attempt to choke him, hell-hounds that can set him on fire with their breath, and many more. Boss battles await Caleb at the end of each episode.</p>
<p>To defend himself against this menace, Caleb utilizes a variety of weapons: a pitchfork; a flare gun that can set enemies on fire; a sawed-off shotgun; a tommy gun; a napalm launcher; TNT bundles which come in three different varieties; a home-made flamethrower made of an aerosol can; a tesla cannon that electrocutes enemies; a magical staff dubbed "Life Leech"; and a voodoo doll. </p>
<p>There are items to pick up strewn around. Unlike most other 3D shooters, the protagonist's health is not replenished via medikits, but by "Life Essences", heart-like power-ups randomly dropped by enemies upon their death. It is also possible to find armor, which comes in three different varieties - Physical, Fire, and Spiritual, each one defending Caleb from different attacks. There are also other power-ups: some (such as Jumping Shoes or Doctor's Bag) can be picked up and activated at any time, while others (such as Partial Invisibility) activate immediately when taken. </p>
<p>As the title implies, violent and gory imagery plays a significant role in the game. Enemies might explode when taken out; it is possible to kick severed heads; impaled victims can be found lying around; enemies die in different ways depending on how they are attacked and in which part of their body, etc.</p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>(Like my <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1938/hexen-beyond-heretic/"> Hexen </a> review, this is an old review I've restored.  It was written for a college mag a friend and I started in '96, so please don't go WTF when I make dated references.)</p>
<p>1997 has been a slow year for us gamers, maybe because we're all hotly anticipating ID's <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Quake+II"> Quake II </a> and other big names such as <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/378/starcraft/"> StarCraft </a>.  Yet I finally have a shooter to sink my teeth into, and be prepared for a shock: I like it better than <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/374/quake/"> Quake </a> and I think its easily the best shoot 'em up since the legendary <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1068/doom/"> Doom.  </a>  What interested me in Doom was its setting, I love horror and I love my blood and guts, so blasting hellish monsters appealed.  Blood attracted my attention while walking through the game store because of its dark cover, simply showing a classic bloody hand print and a simple enough name.</p>
<p>That simple name tells you all you need to know about the game, there is blood.  Lots and lots of Blood.  This is easily the bloodiest game I've played, and while that means it isn't for the squeamish, it brings a lot of catharsis and excitement for someone who wants to blow off stress.  In many ways the premise is similar to Doom, shooting zombies and hellish minions, but whats different is instead of being set in space, Blood is set in a strange, somewhat surreal version of the 1920's owned by an evil cult.  The setting is awesome, and so is the main character, Caleb.  Caleb is an undead cowboy who wants to kill a demon god.  So yeah, basically his level of awesomeness is on that of Bruce Campbell.  This makes him a compelling protagonist and his sick sense of humour is refreshing for those who like bleak and morbid humour.</p>
<p>Gameplay is much like Doom, but enhanced.  I actually decided to pass up on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/365/duke-nukem-3d/"> Duke Nukem </a> so I'm new to the Build engine.  Many of the restraints of Doom are gone, rooms are more realistic with multiple levels, special walls that can be blown apart, and interactivity with objects.  Various dark jokes can be found, but even better than the dark jokes, are various references and tributes to H.P. Lovecraft.  As a fan of his writings and owing him thanks for my namesake "The Dreamquest of Unknown Kadath," I always get a smile on my face when I find a tribute to his writings.  The game also has various references to horror movies, and has a tributes and references to movies such as "The Evil Dead" and "The Exorcist."  Finding these references are a joy for literature fans as well as horror movie fans.</p>
<p>Weapons range from dynamite, flare guns, Tommy guns (!), and my favourite, the voodoo doll.  Did I mention this game was gory?  Each weapon makes minced meat out of your foes in different ways, the flare gun will set them on fire and burn their flesh off.  The Tommy guns will leave you with something resembling Swiss cheese.  There are power ups that let you dual wield weapons and more.  This adds for a lot of variety and fun with the weapons.  The engine is great, and while I'm sure there have been games like this before, this is my first exposure to a shooter with such variety and interactive environments.  </p>
<p>Each episode gets better and better, but that's what one would expect.  The game is for hardcore shooter fans only, the difficulty is insane even on "Easy" mode for some.  Blood brings back memories of the difficulty of playing "Thy Flesh Consumed" from Ultimate Doom on Ultra Violence.  The games AI is also fierce and smart, as well as having great variety.  Zombies are great at tricking you, they'll go down but sometimes get back up and follow you.  On the harder difficulty levels, you'll learn to make sure to take their head off, that's the only way next to burning them or gibbing them to keep them down.  The developers put great thought into the demonic enemies, and this spices up the encounters.</p>
<p>While not as intense as Quake, the multiplayer is fun.  What makes it above average is simply the games twisted weapons and the fact that this has to be the only game where you can twist your foes head off with a voodoo doll, and some of the maps have traps that will give you a shock and an upper hand once you figure them out.  If you have the game, feel free to set up a game with me.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is very moody.  It sounds creepy and despite the dark humour that keeps the game from truly being 100% horror, the soundtrack has some very unique CD music that will send chills.  The soundtrack stands out amongst other games like this, and some of the instruments used will raise an eyebrow, but in a good way.  The rest of the game sounds great as well, there are tons of great screams and sound effects that compliment the brutal setting and make levels feel realistic.  Monsters make various noises, both funny and scary.  Much like "Evil Dead," the game is both scary and utterly hysterical.  The developers have set up a great soundscape here. </p>
<p>The level design is great, and levels will take you through many dark and strange places.  From a hilariously twisted carnival to a Frankenstein like laboratory filled with sick, acid vomiting zombies and severed and possessed hands seeking the first undead cowboys neck they can get a hold of.  The soundscapes have sound effects that will keep you in the settings and they feel like real locations.  <br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>The graphics, while not "bad," feel dated compared to Quake.  The game uses sprites, and while the sprites are often detailed it can be jarring to switch from the smooth 3D world of Quake to the rough, heavily pixelated world of Blood.  There are a few 3D models used for various objects in the world, but you'll sadly never see any 3D characters or weapons other than pickups.  The upside however, assuming you can run it, is that Blood will run at massive resolutions.  I played the game at 1024 x 768 and some of the games more impressive effects looked great.</p>
<p>As I said, the game is difficult.  While I like this difficulty, there are times that it can be frustrating and sometimes I forgot to make a save and ended up returning halfway through a level.  Others won't like this difficulty and if you aren't up for a brutish challenge, then you might want to avoid Blood.</p>
<p>Some of the level designs are somewhat obtuse and annoying.  The heavy scripting usually works in the games favor, but other times it brings the game down.  The game doesn't always tell you what to do or give you a clue of how to continue, and you'll be annoyed when you find out that you had to trigger some script or place dynamite in some strange place.  Sometimes I got bored running in circles trying to trigger some stupid and needlessly cryptic event.</p>
<p>Sound Blaster fans beware, although the game supports the Sound Blaster line, there are various crashes that happened because of poor Sound Blaster integration.  There's also stuttering at some times if you have a sound blaster and decide to use stereo sound or high number of voices.  Hopefully this will be remedied, but only time will tell.  Speaking of hardware issues, the year is 1997 and the game has no Windows 95 executable out of the box nor on the net.  Anyone who is a long term gamer shouldn't have any trouble tinkering in Dos, and I know not everyone uses Windows, but I've gotten used to having Windows support and I felt that the game could've been optimized better for it.</p>
<p>The multiplayer only supports 8 players with no co-op.  Maybe I've been spoiled by Quake, but I think that they could've upped the player cap to 16.  8 players is still great fun though, but those spoiled on Quake might like to double the player limit.</p>
<p>The music is good, but it does sometimes feel slow paced, and without the CD music it feels somewhat bland.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Blood is one of my favourite games of this year and easily the best shooter in years.  I doubt it will replace Quake and the upcoming Quake II will likely muffle Blood, which is sad because the game is extremely fun.  It is funny, it's creepy, and it pays great tribute to horror movies and literature as well as using a unique setting.  If you like your guts, Blood delivers on that too.  The unique weapons make multiplayer good enough to hold its own with Quake, and as always, Chie, Mike &amp; I are always up for a good deathmatch on Saturdays, so feel free to bring your copy and play us.  Blood isn't for the squeamish, but it's devilishly fun.  </p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>Blood is not a revolutionary game. But it did have the most unusual plot I have ever seen in a FPS. Let me start with level design, for you traverse many real-world locations I have yet to see duplicated in any other FPS. The weapon selection is better than in any other FPS ever made, for where else could you use an aerosol can or flare gun to set your enemies on fire and watch them scream, "It burns!" The enemies are also memorable, for you have cultists which shout Latin-Sanskrit phrases at you (which have real English translations), and zombies who emerge from the ground and say "More Brains." The graphics, while considered poor by today's standards, (though I like them) do add a certain atmosphere to the game. Also, the one-liners from Caleb, Blood's protagonist, are what set it apart from others of the same genre.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>The bosses are to easy to defeat. Shial is quite scary though. The violence in Blood is intense, so if you do not like violent video games stay away from this one.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>One of the best FPS around. Much better than Duke Nukem 3-D. Find and play it, you are sure to have one of the best experiences ever in computer gaming. </p>

            <p><strong>The Good</strong><br>It's probably immediately obvious from the game's title that this isn't exactly a game for the sensitive, but I'll go through the usual caveat anyway. Blood is one of the most violent games ever made, certainly the most violent I've ever played. There's so much red stuff in this game you wonder if it affected the developers' vision. You can shoot limbs off bodies, aim at heads and watch them explode like cans of tomato soup, and splatter gore over the walls when you blast enemies to their component parts with the sawed-off shotgun. Along the way of your blood-soaked journey you'll frequently encounter mutilated human bodies nailed to the walls: some of them are still twitching.  The game's violence is so over-the-top and campy it isn't really scary or disturbing -- quite the opposite -- but it's still the reason many people should avoid this game. But those who can handle the ultra violence will find a fun and memorable shooter.</p>
<p>The story: at the age of 18, Caleb already has a reputation as a merciless gunfighter in the mid-1840s American West. He comes across a destroyed homestead and a weeping woman, who tells him that her name is Ophelia and her husband and everything she had was destroyed by a cult of demon-worshippers called the Cabal. Her husband had been a member of the Cabal, but had tried to escape from it, and retaliation had been swift. Tearfully, she asks him if he wants to join the Cabal, and for some damned reason he accepts. The demon the Cabal serves, Tchernobog: The One That Binds; The Sleeping God; yadda yadda, invites a select few of his followers to a secret ceremony. There, he kills everyone, (including Caleb and Ophelia) and uses their power to augment his own. But Caleb survives (well, not really, he dies and gets resurrected. The game never tells us how), and from there on the plot unfolds along fairly familiar lines. Caleb sets out for revenge on Tchernobog and his army of followers, and hopefully I don't have to explain anything else about Blood's story.</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me about Blood was its incredible detail. Get up close to the walls, and you can actually see small details like fungus and slime in the brickwork. Your enemies have several death animations each (one from getting shot dead-on, another from getting shot from the side, another from getting burned alive, etc.), and, true to Ken Silverman's Build engine, you can destroy, move, or interact with almost everything. It's one thing shooting exploding barrels in Doom, but in Blood you can do things like crush enemies by pushing a wooden crate off a ledge on to them, and kick decapitated enemy heads around like footballs. Blood is an insidiously fun, destructive game.</p>
<p>Blood is technologically adept, featuring things such as transparent water, realistic lighting, and great physics. The Build engine is probably the most advanced 2.5D engine ever developed, and Blood takes full advantage of this with things like rooms above rooms (the game's most tense moment is when you're walking a treacherously narrow causeway across a pit of snakes). As far as visual appeal goes the game falls a bit flat, the sprites get pixely and blurred when you get up close (but that's true of every raycast game) and the colours seem a bit bland and washed out. The game is using very old technology and it shows. But the game's system requirements are certainly modest, and I haven't encountered a single bug or glitch while playing -- not even on Windows XP, which apparently is the bane of Build games.</p>
<p>The game's levels (for the most part) are simply awesome. I really pity anyone who is trying to create a mod of Blood 2, all the good ideas have already been used in the game. Rather than just endless levels that take place in a dungeon or building, you'll blast enemies to shreds in locales such as on board a ship, in an abandoned amusement park, and in a snow-covered forest. The design of the levels is top notch, with a good balance of puzzles that require thinking and areas that you can just blast your way through, there are blessfully few "fetch the silver key" style puzzles, although completing some levels usually entails unlocking a secret area somewhere. The weapons are diverse and satisfying. Some enemies are resistant to certain weapon types, so you'll have to be prepared to switch around a lot. Of course, there's the requisite shotgun and pistol, and a few more unusual things like the aerasol spray can and the voodoo doll. I liked it how you could dual wield, with a weapon in each hand. The monsters, I'll admit, are unremarkable, mostly just copies of those from Doom and Quake, with a few rats, bats and spiders thrown in for good measure. But in all fairness they are extremely detailed and have so many different animations that it almost makes up for the fact that Monolith is firing creative blanks.</p>
<p>Blood's multiplayer, I think, deserves its own section. The server Monolith had set up for the game (games.lith.com) was taken down years ago, but as with almost all popular titles that have been abandoned by their developers new servers have been set up elsewhere by fans. Bloodbath (as multiplayer mode is affectionately known) is as exciting as multiplayer FPS games can get. There are just so many varied weapons and powerups, (not to mention Blood's naturally flexible engine that allows for things like bouncing grenades off walls to kill enemy players that are hiding behind corners) that Bloodbath mode kept me entertained for weeks after beating the game in single player mode. The game comes with 9 excellent multiplayer levels, and there's even a utility on the install CD that allows you to create your own.</p>
<p>And of course, there's the humour. There are the obligatory wisecracks from our protagonist (when entering a hospital Caleb will remark "hmmm...a hospital. I might donate someone elses blood.")  and things such as the "No Zombies Allowed" sign at the amusement park. There are so many references to H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe novels that the game's trivia section would probably be twice as large if someone went and documented them all. The game has a morbid "gallows humour" attitude that I quite liked, cue being able to kick zombie heads around. And there are those annoying people that run around incessantly screaming as zombies chase them. They're cute at first, but after a few levels I started ventilating their skulls with a bullet whenever I saw them just to shut them up.<br><br><strong>The Bad</strong><br>here are few things I can really fault Blood on. It aims at providing Doom-style action and succeeds very well at that. The excessive gore is probably nothing more than an attempt to distinguish it from the crowd (there's no such thing as bad press, so the saying goes.) One thing I didn't like was that the game often falls back on jumping puzzles. Jumping puzzles shouldn't really be in FPS games, you can't see your feet and it's little more than an exercise in frustration because of that. A lot of E4L2 is just jumping from wooden pylon to wooden pylon over a pit of lava, and I believe I died more times in that part than in all the other parts of the game put together. That was the only time I was genuinely frustrated with Blood.<br><br><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>Other than the violence hook, Blood is a neat little game and a good example of the genre. Recommended if you've got a high gore tolerance and you can find it.</p>

  <h2>Trivia
    
  </h2>
  <div id="trivia-text" class="text-break-word shrink-headings toggle-long-text">
    <h3>3dfx patch</h3>
<p>Monolith released an alpha patch for <em>Blood</em> that provided 3DFX support. Unfortunately, being an alpha patch, it only works with version 1.0 of <em>Blood</em>, not <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/3353/one-unit-whole-blood/">One Unit Whole Blood</a>. It is also incompatible with Voodoo Rush and Voodoo 2 chipsets. </p>
<h3>Cultists</h3>
<p>The strange language spoken by the cultists is supposed to be a combination of Latin and Sanskrit. Sanskrit is the ancient language of India, from which several modern languages of that region originated. </p>
<h3>Cut features</h3>
<p>One early feature that Q Studios was planning to add to Blood was the idea of "BloodLust". According to this feature, each time when the player killed a minion of the Dark God, his BloodLust meter climbed a notch. If his BloodLust climbed high enough, he metamorphosed into the Beast. As the Beast, he was supposed to be stronger and faster than a human, but he was also limited in his choice of weaponry. Of course, BloodLust waned with time--if the player did not kill frequently, he reverted to human form. This feature was not added to the final release of the game.</p>
<h3>Death Mask</h3>
<p>Death Mask, the power-up that makes you invincible for a short period of time, does not tint your view with color while active, so it's impossible to see when it runs out, which makes it somewhat less useful. The Monolith team admitted that they forgot to implement this. </p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>Apogee were the ones who started production on this game in 1994. The developers were Q Studios Corporation (an independent game development studio). In the short while they were working on it, they called it <em>Horror 3D</em>. After a while the rights for the game was sold to Monolith which completed the game and changed the name to <em>Blood</em>, which we're familiar with today. </p>
<h3>Extras</h3>
<p>Some versions of <em>Blood</em> came with a second CD that contained demos and the video for <em>Love you to Death</em> by the appropriately gloomy band Type O Negative.</p>
<h3>German index</h3>
<p>On June 28, 1997, Blood was put on the infamous German index by the BPjS. The <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/4362/bpjs-bpjm-indexed-games/">game group</a> contains more information about what this means.</p>
<h3>Inactivity</h3>
<p>When you stand still for a few seconds, Caleb starts to sing lounge classics. Some of the songs he knows are <em>My Way</em>, <em>Puttin' on the Ritz</em>, <em>Somewhere Over the Rainbow</em>. <em>There's No Business Like Show Business</em> and <em>Strangers in the Night</em>.</p>
<h3>References</h3>
<ul>
<li>The game contains easter eggs with references to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Jack+Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Duke+Nukem">Duke Nukem</a> and <em>The Crow</em>. The tips &amp; tricks section contains information how to reach them.</li>
<li>In the level after the train level, you will able to see in the rest of the train, the clothes of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/25947/harrison-ford/">Harrison Ford</a>'s charachter in <em>The Fugitive</em></li>
<li>The cheat code for god mode in <em>Blood</em> is 'mpkfa', where 'mp' stands for Monolith productions and 'kfa' is taken from 'idkfa', the cheat code for all weapons in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=DOOM:+Evil+Unleashed">DOOM</a>. It seems like Monolith was paying a tribute to <em>DOOM</em>.</li>
<li>In the first level of the third episode, there's a secret room which is based on the infamous "Sloth" murder from the movie <em>Se7en</em>. There are those goody-smelly Wunderbaum trees hanging on the ceiling and the word "Sloth" is written in blood just above the bed.</li>
<li>In the level "Crystal Lake" you can find several locations from the <em>Friday The 13th</em> horror movies. Indeed, the name of the level itself references Camp Crystal Lake, the setting of many films in the series.</li>
<li>There is one gag available only in the <em>Blood</em> shareware that did not make it to the retail version of the game. During the first mission (E1M1) on the second floor of the Mausoleum there is an embalming room with a conveyor belt and a furnace. Among the items in this room are the "drips" that one would find in a hospital. Some a filled with what can only be blood. In the shareware version if one activates the blood drip one hears Caleb draw a big slurp, and exclaim "Aaah, tastes like Kool-Aid." This line was dropped from the Retail version, most likely due to copyright issues. Thus when Caleb takes a drink we only hear the slurping sound effect, and the subsequent "Aaah."</li>
<li>Axe-wielding zombies say "Brains" or "More Brains" and there are dormant zombies found in metal drums. These are all references to the <em>Return of the Living Dead</em> films.</li>
<li>A sign in E1M1 says "Welcome to Morningside Funeral Home" with the Morningside crossed out with spraypaint and replaced with "HELL." The name "Morningside" is likely a reference to the antagonist's name from the <em>Phantasm</em> movies.</li>
<li>In E1M1, if you try to use the sink, Caleb says "out, out, damned spot!" It is a reference to Lady Macbeth washing her hands of blood in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/369869/william-shakespeare/">Shakespeare</a>'s play <em>Macbeth</em>.</li>
<li>In E1M2 the train station is called Central Miskatonic, a reference to H. P. Lovecraft's works.</li>
<li>The train in E1M3 has the name "Phantom 666" emblazoned on the side, a reference to the "Number of the Beast" 666 in Biblical prophecy.</li>
<li>When you have the Incinerator equipped, Caleb will occasionally remark "I love the smell of napalm in the morning," a reference to <em>Apocalypse Now</em>.</li>
<li>In E3M2, enter the wine cellar and Caleb will comment on a certain barrel "A cask of Amontillado!" <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/6389/edgar-allan-poe/">Edgar Allen Poe</a> wrote a short story with the same name. Destroy the barrel and you'll find several sawn off limbs and body parts inside.</li>
<li>In the secret level "Butchery Loves Company" you can find a hidden area with a <em>Duke Nukem</em> arcade machine. Caleb will remark "I don't have time to play with you," a corruption of one of Duke's many one-liners.</li>
<li>Caleb's opening line "I...live...AGAIN!" is lifted out of <em>Army of Darkness</em>.</li>
<li>One of the lines spoken by Caleb while massacring enemies is "Da-da-da-dat's all, folks!", a reference to the famous closing line from Warner Bros. cartoons, as delivered by Porky Pig.</li>
<li>And if you 'activate' Eric Draven's gravestone on the first level of Blood, Caleb will say 'Nevermore'. As in "Quoth the raven: 'nevermore' " of course, from Edgar Allan Poe's poem "The Raven".</li>
<li>In one further piece of homage in this densely referential work, on the second page of the "default keys" reference, characters from <em>Blood</em> will comically re-enact gameplay from <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Pac-Man">Pac-Man</a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Asteroids">Asteroids</a> and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Donkey+Kong">Donkey Kong</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shareware</h3>
<p>The shareware version of the game contains many things that are not present in the full version, such as mushrooms that cause you to become delirious. The shareware levels are also slightly different in the full version. For example: E1M2 has been updated to include civilians which are not present in the shareware.</p>
<h3>Tchernobog</h3>
<p>The name Tchernobog means black god (crno bog) in Slavic dialect. It is a pagan deity dated from ancient 12th century Slavic religion.</p>
<h3>Wal-Mart</h3>
<p>Wal-Mart required special editions of this game to be made before they would sell it. Identical to the original game in most aspects, they toned down the gore and removed any nudity.</p>
